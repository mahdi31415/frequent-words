•    I love listening to the whole song, just for this one line.
•    I don’t really remember how I first came across this song, but it was about two three years ago.
•    I think I might have heard it in a café or a music channel in the TV.
•    Whenever, I am feeling low or I don’t feel like studying, I listen to the song for motivation.
•    The song just energizes me and makes me work even harder.

            •   But the lyrics also have a darker meaning.
            •   The singer Avcii committed suicide at a very young age about two years ago.
            •   I remember the news came as a huge shock to me.
            •   When I searched online, I came to know, Avcii was going through depression.
            •   But one day, when I was listening to this song, I realized how Avcii’s death really gave life to the
                lyrics.
            •   His body did leave this Earth, but people will never forget him.
            •   People will always remember him through his songs.
            •   He has immortalized his memory through his meaningful song lyrics.
            •   I also really want to do something for my family, my society and my country.
            •   So that people also remember me after I leave this world.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. Are you good at memorizing things?
      I am neither very good nor am I bad at memorizing things. But, I do make a list on my phone
      for all the important things because I don’t want to risk forgetting them.

   2. Do you think children like the rhythm of songs or poems?
      Yes, I think rhythms make it fun. I think rhymes reduce inhibition among children and make
      them more active. That is why teachers use rhymes while teaching.

   3. Do you think it is easier for children to learn songs or poems than adults?
      I think yes. I remember in my childhood, I used to memorize many poems and I did it very
      easily. I don’t think I can do the same now. I think it is maybe because in childhood, our




                                                                    m
      brains are more receptive.

   4. What can people learn from songs or poems?

      I think the two main things we learn from songs and poems is our culture and language. In
      general, there is a lot of repetition in songs and rhymes stick in the learner’s mind and the

      development. Similarly, some songs and poems also connect us with our culture as their

                2. Describe a tradition in your country (makkar|IELTS)
           You should say
              - What it is
              - Who takes part in it
              - What activities there are
              - And explain how you feel about it

               •   There are many traditions in India.
               •   But today I would like to talk about a tradition which is quite popular especially in North
                   India.
               •   The tradition is called ‘karvachauth’.
               •   It is actually a tradition in which women keep a fast from sunrise to moonrise for the safety
                   and longevity of their husbands.
               •   It is celebrated on a special day based on the Hindu Lunar Calendar.
               •   It is mainly a Hindu tradition but some women from Sikh religion also celebrate it.
               •   Its origin is based on military campaigns of the past.
               •   The men would go to wars, and women would keep a fast for their safe return.
               •   In today’s time, it is seen as a symbol of love and affection between a husband and wife.
               •   In fact, nowadays even men keep a fast along with women to support them.
               •   Women begin preparing for Karva Chauth a few days in advance, by buying adornments
                   jewelry, and other prayer items.
               •   On the day of Karva Chauth, women dress up and at night they do a small prayer along with
                   husbands with the moon in the backdrop.
               •   After this, they break their fast.
               •   Earlier, I saw this tradition as a symbol of patriarchy in some sense, where only women are
                   meant to keep a fast.
               •   But now I see it more as a symbol of love and sacrifice
               •   I think as long as there is no compulsion on women to do this and they do this on their own,
                   there is nothing wrong with it.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. What is the importance of traditional festivals?
      I think traditional festivals fulfil three functions. They connect us to our roots, our culture
      and our origins, giving us a sense of identity. Secondly, they bring families and friends
      together and lastly, they help us forget about our worries and stress.

   2. What’s the difference between festivals now and in the past?
      I think the main difference between festivals now and in the past is the purpose of
      celebration. Earlier people celebrated festivals for a purpose, but now people have
      forgotten the meaning behind the festivals. Festivals are only celebrated for joy and
      merriment.




                                                                      m
   3. Do you think western festivals like Christmas are replacing traditional festivals in your
      country?

      decorate a tree and ask for gifts from my parents on Christmas. Similarly, in these past few
      years, I have seen children going for trick or treating on Halloween in my neighborhood.

   4. Do you think it is wrong for children not to celebrate traditional festivals?
      I wish children today are as passionate about celebrating traditional festivals as they are

                3. Describe a person who you think is very open
                   You should say (m@kk@rIELTS)
                   - Who this person is
                   - How you know this person
                   - Why do you think this person is very open
                   - And explain how you feel about this person

               •   I think very few people today are open and frank.
               •   I myself am not very open and I don’t find it easy to express my feelings.
               •   But I really think that my mother is a very open person.
               •   I have experienced her straightforward nature many times.
               •   She doesn’t hide her thoughts and feelings. She openly expresses them.
               •   For example, I recently made a cake.
               •   She found it too sweet and when I asked for her opinion, she clearly said she didn’t like it.
               •   And she isn’t like that with us family members only, but others also.
               •   She speaks her mind.
               •   Sometimes people get offended due to this too.
               •   But as people get to know her, they understand that she is just being straight forward and
                   her intention is to help and not to insult.
               •   Over the years, I have found that more and more people appreciate her for
                   straightforwardness rather than take offense.
               •   Her straightforward and direct nature is also a reason, many of our relatives and neighbours
                   come and share their worries with her.
               •   They know she will speak her mind.
               •   I think it requires a lot of courage for a person to be open and direct.
               •   I care too much about other people’s feelings and as a result sometimes I lie or make
                   promises I can’t keep.
               •   My mother never does that, and I think she is really brave deep-down.
               •   She is very secure about herself and she is not afraid to show her true self to people.
               •   I really wish I could be more open like that.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. Is it difficult for Indian people to express their feelings?
      Yes, I think Indian people are very polite and considerate and because of that most people
      don’t express their feelings easily in public. Also, I think a lot of us care about our image
      more than our mental peace and so we hide our feelings.

   2. Who do you think talk more? Children or grown-ups?
      Definitely children, and there are two reasons for it. First, they are curious because of their
      age and this curiosity only gets satisfied by asking questions. Second, they are not afraid to
      speak their mind because they don’t care about appearing rude or hurting others by their
      words. Adults also ignore children’s words because of their age.




                                                                     m
   3. What do you think is the difference between boys and girls in expressing their feelings?
      I think girls are generally more open in expressing their feelings. Boys think they might
      appear weak, if they show their feelings and as a result, they try to hide them. This carries




                                                                 o
      on to adult life too. That is why I think women complain about their husbands not opening
      up.

                                                      rs
      On the contrary, I think people are less open. I think people today are more worried about
      their image and thus they try to present themselves as a perfect person. But this in turn
                                                   e

      means they hide their true feelings. Also, I think people today lay more emphasis on
      politeness and thus they don’t speak up if they feel something is wrong.

                4. Describe an old friend you got in contact with again
                   You should say ( m a k k a r I E L T S)
               -   Who he or she is
               -   What he or she is like
               -   How you got in contact
               -   And explain how you felt about it

               •   Due to fast-paced life of today, it is very easy to lose contact with friends.
               •   I have also lost contact with many of school time friends.
               •   It happened inadvertently.
               •   Some of my friends got busy with jobs, some shifted to another city and some just got busy
                   with family life.
               •   However, during this Corona pandemic, life slowed down.
               •   I was home all the time and this also meant that I spent more time on social media
                   especially Facebook.
               •   So, two or three months ago, I got a friend request from one of my school-time friends,
                   Navneet.
               •   He had shifted to Canada when we were in 8th standard.
               •   For the first two three months, we tried to keep contact but eventually we all got busy with
                   studies.
               •   So, it was a pleasant surprise to receive his friend request.
               •   Navneet was one of my best friends in school.
               •   I don’t use these words for anyone, but he was in real sense ‘a jack of all trades ’.
               •   He was good in academics and sports as well.
               •   When we were in school, he was the captain of the football team.
               •   In studies, he was always among the top four five students.
               •   Despite all this, he was very modest and still he is very modest.
               •   He never tried to show that he was superior to others.
               •   It was so fun talking to him.
               •   It felt like I had travelled back in time.
               •   We reminisced about our school days and both of us became a bit nostalgic.
               •   I think it was a bittersweet feeling getting in touch with him after so long.
               •   On the one hand, we both felt a bit guilty about losing touch.
               •   On the other hand, we were also very happy to talk to each other after so long.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. What is the influence of social media on friendships?
      I think social media has definitely enabled us to maintain friendships better. We all know
      our friends are just a click away. At the same time it has all reduced face to face contact, and
      I think that has weakened the bonds of friendships.

   2. Why do people lose contact with each other after graduation?
      I think the main reason is that we get busy with jobs. Moreover, sometimes people move to
      another city for a job. We don’t see our friends daily and we come in contact with new
      people. Building new friendships consumes time and thus inadvertently people lose touch
      with friends.




                                                                    m
   3. Do people in your country like to make new friends?
      Definitely, I think Indians in essence are very social. We love conversation, meeting new
      people. Every time, I travel, I come back with new contact in my phone.




                                                                o
   4. Do you think old friends are more important to the old generation or the young generation?



                                                           .c
      I think old friends are important to both new and old generation. I think talking with
      childhood friends takes people back to childhood days in some sense and most people miss
                                                      rs
      that time – a time free of tensions and worries.

                  5. Describe a family which you like and are happy to
                     know
                   You should say (MAKKARIELTS)
               -   Who they are
               -   Where they live
               -   How you know them
               -   And explain why you like them.

              •    I know many families that live in our neighbourhood.
              •    But there is one family, that I really enjoy spending time with.
              •    They are our next-door neighbor’s, Sharmas.
              •    There are four members in the family, Mr. Sharma, his wife and their two children,
                   Navneet and Priya.
              •    I think they shifted to Phagwara and our neighbourhood about five years ago.
              •    Before that they lived in Jalandhar.
              •    Mr. Sharma works in a bank and he was transferred to Phagwara branch five years ago.
              •    That’s how they came to live in Phagwara and our neighbourhood.
              •    I remember immediately after moving to our neighbourhood, they invited everyone for a
                   dinner.
              •    Their son is the same age as me and he and I have become very close friends.
              •    There are many things I like about them, but the first is that they don’t do any formalities.
              •    I don’t get the feeling that I am at somebody else’s house when I am at their home.
              •    For example, they offer me things to eat when I go there, but they don’t force it.
              •    They just tell me not to hesitate if I want to eat something.
              •    It’s another matter that Mrs Sharma is a very good cook and I actually look forward to
                   tasting all the delicacies she makes.
              •    I also like the relationship between Mr and Mrs Sharma and the children.
              •    They are strict but friendly and they encourage their children to share whatever problems
                   they are facing.
              •    I have never seen Mr and Mrs Sharma raise their voice.
              •    I have noticed that my friend Navneet, shares nearly every detail of his life with his parents.
              •    If he does something bad, they don’t scold but tell him why it was wrong.
              •    I think very few people have this special dynamic relation with their parents.
              •    In all, I get very positive vibes from all the members of the family.
              •    I feel very comfortable at their home and that’s why I like them a lot.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. Who is usually the leader in an Indian family?
      India is a patriarchal society, and, in most families, the eldest male member is the leader. If
      it’s a joint family, its generally the grandfather and in nuclear families it’s the father.

   2. How do grandparents take care of their children?
      I think today grandparents fill the void left behind by working parents. Both the parents
      work today and as such are not able to devote enough time to the children. So,
      grandparents raise children just like parents. They also teach them about moral values. In
      some ways, they are also responsible for spoiling children as they give in to their demands
      much more easily than parents do.




                                                                     m
   3. What’s the most important quality of a good parent?
      I think the best quality in a good parent is flexibility. Flexible parents tend to be open-
      minded and easy-going. They resolve disagreements smoothly. Children are naturally




                                                                 o
      defiant and thus inflexible parents increase defiance and rebelliousness in their children and
      this always escalates conflicts.



                                                            .c
   4. How can new parents learn about parenting?      rs
      I think there are many ways to learn about good parenting. They can read books on
      parenting. they can join parenting classes, they can watch videos on you-tube about
                                                   e

      parenting and last but not least they can take guidance from their own parents.

                6. Describe an energetic person that you know
                   You should say
               -   Who this person is
               -   How you know this person
               -   Why you think this person is energetic
               -   And explain how you feel about this person

               •   When I started thinking about an energetic person, one person came to mind especially.
               •   His name is Mr. Vikas Chaudhary and he works as a personal fitness trainer at a gym in my
                   hometown.
               •   I came to know him, when I joined the gym last year.
               •   When I joined, I was very clueless about which machines to use, how much weights to use
                   and what exercises to do as a beginner.
               •   Mr. Vikas was the one who guided me even though I hadn’t paid for personal training
                   services.
               •   He took special notice that I was a beginner and whenever I did any exercise, he told me
                   about the correct posture and corrected me if I was wrong.
               •   A few weeks later, I sent him a friend request on Facebook.
               •   That’s how I came to know that he is a very active and energetic person.
               •   Firstly, he works a personal trainer 6 days from 8 AM to 8 PM, which involves a lot of
                   physical activity.
               •   Before that, he goes for 1-hour jogging session daily.
               •   Every Sunday, he plays football for two three hours with his friends.
               •   So, he does some form of physical activity every day of the week besides his job, which is
                   also physical.
               •   Because of all this, he has a very impressive, lean and muscular physique.
               •   Another thing I like about him is that he doesn’t take any supplements and he doesn’t
                   encourage others to take supplements either.
               •   He believes in protein-rich diet but without any supplements.
               •   Recently, there was a fitness competition in Phagwara, and he got second prize in the
                   competition.
               •   He is a big motivation for me.
               •   I want to have an active lifestyle and have a physique like him.
               •   I feel it takes a lot of effort to maintain a physique like him and it shows the hard work that
                   he puts into his body.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. What kind of jobs need a lot of physical activity?
      I think with the coming of computers and technology, a lot of jobs don’t require as much
      physical activity as in the past. Still, there are a few jobs which involve manual labour like
      masonry, plumbing, painting etc. which involve a lot of physical activity.

   2. What’s the difference between payment for physical work and payment for mental work?
      It’s a fact that today as a society we give more importance to mental work as compared to
      physical work. So, jobs which require mental work entail a much higher salary than jobs with
      physical work. In India especially, jobs with physical work like farming, plumbing, painting,
      working in factories are some of the least paid jobs.




                                                                     m
   3. Can physical workers have higher salaries in the future?
      On the contrary, I think physical workers would have even lower salaries in the future
      relatively. This is because machines are gradually replacing manual work and I think the




                                                                 o
      need for manual labour is coming down tremendously.




                                                            .c
   4. Do you think machines could replace manual labor in the future?
      I don’t think machines will replace manual labor completely but there would definitely be an
                                                       rs
      impact. I think with a coming of new technologies, new types of jobs will be created, which
      will require different skill sets. This in fact is already visible for example with the coming of
                                                   e

      driverless cars – there has been a fall in the jobs for drivers.

              - And explain how you felt about it


               •   I go for a walk every day at a park near my home.
               •   Usually, I also see a few children playing at the park during that time.
               •   And they are always accompanied by an adult.
               •   Last week when I went to the park, I saw that the children instead of playing were actually
                   uprooting the flowers and plants.
               •   I tried to see if there was an adult nearby who knew the children.
               •   There were a few others who were here for a walk like me, but I didn’t think anyone knew the
                   children.
               •   Some of them had also stopped and were thinking about what to do.
               •   However, an old uncle couldn’t watch this any longer.
               •   He went up to the kids and told them to stop doing that immediately.
               •   However, instead of scolding, he started telling them that how plants are living beings like us
                   and uprooting them is like killing them.
               •   He then tried to make the best of situation and asked the children to help him replant the
                   trees.
               •   Seeing this, some of other people and I also joined in and helped him.
               •   At first, I was very angry, but I also knew that the children didn’t understand the consequences
                   of their action.
               •   After listening to the uncle, they stopped and actually helped in replanting the plants.
               •   Still, some of plants had broken roots and we knew nothing could be done to save them.
               •   But we didn’t say anything to the children because we didn’t want to make them feel even
                   more guilty. (makkarIELTS)
               •   When a person came to pick them up, we did explain the situation.
               •   He apologized on behalf of the children and told us that he was sorry for leaving them
                   unattended.
               •   I learned one thing from that old man rather than scolding children for their mistakes, it is our
                   responsibility as a society to guide them and enable them to become better human beings.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions


   1. What bad behaviour do children usually have?
      Normally, the bad behavior I associate with children is creating noise, breaking things,
      disrespecting elders, scribbling on the walls and stealing small things like pencils, erasers. I
      think I am guilty of each one of them when I was young.

   2. How should parents stop their children from behaving badly at public?
      I think parents should stop their children from doing bad things at home. There should be no
      double standards. Moreover, I think parents should not just stop children from doing
      something bad but also tell them why it is bad to do it.




                                                                      m
   3. Are parents these days stricter than in the past?
      On the contrary, I think parents are more lenient these days. I think it is mainly due to two
      reasons, first being the strict laws against physical punishment and the second reason is the




                                                                  o
      influence of western culture.




                                                             .c
   4. Whose influence on children is more? Parents or their Friends?
      I think in the early years, the parents influence is second to none as children spend majority
                                                       rs
      of their time with the parents. But as children grow older, they spend considerably more time
      with their friends and I think during these years it is their friends that influence their behavior
                                                    e

                8. Describe a conversation topic you were not
                   interested in
               -   Who you talked with
               -   When you had the conversation
               -   What the topic was
               -   And explain why you were not interested

               •   Last week, we went to my Uncle’s house as it was my cousin’s engagement.
               •   There, some of my other cousins started a conversation about the recent Sushant Singh
                   Rajput suicide case.
               •   For the past few weeks, the main news coverage has been all about Sushant Singh Rajput.
               •   And it was a controversial issue from the start.
               •   There are some people who believe it was suicide, while there are others who believe it was
                   murder.
               •   However, I was actually tired of the hearing about the issue for the past two- three months.
               •   I was hoping that at the wedding, we would talk about something else.
               •   I was actually more interested in talking about the opening of schools, Indo-China border
                   conflict and state of the economy and more than anything else our personal lives.
               •   I felt that discussing the topic of Sushant Singh Rajput was depressing in some ways.
               •   I know mental health is an issue which needs more discussion among people, and I felt that
                   the engagement was a joyous occasion and it was not the right place for the discussion.
               •   During the conversation, each of my cousins, came up with weird theory what actually
                   happened.
               •   It was like – they were there, they knew Sushant Singh Rajput personally.
               •   I actually wanted to say if we could discuss something else, as none of us could really know
                   what actually happened and we should just wait for the investigative agencies to conclude
                   their proceedings.
               •   But, the rest of my cousins were really interested in the discussion.
               •   So, I didn’t say anything.
               •   After about fifteen minutes, I just pretended that I received a phone call and went to
                   another room.
               •   But that was no respite as there my uncles were discussing the same topic.
               •   For the rest of the time, I just played games on my phone call.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. What topics do young people in India talk about?
      The youth in India talk about nearly everything from politics to sports to fashion to
      technological gadgets. Personally, I love to talk about mobile phones and computers with
      my friends.

   2. What is the difference between topics that are popular now and topics that were popular in
      the past?
      I think earlier people didn’t care so much about technology, but it is a major part of the
      conversation now. I also love talking about that. In addition, I think rest of the topics like




                                                                      m
      sports, fashion and politics were actively discussed in the past too.

   3. How do you know if others are not interested in the conversation?




                                                                  o
      I think I mostly see people’s facial reactions to see if they are interested. If they are laughing
      at my jokes or their facial reactions are changing as the tone of the conversation changes,



                                                             .c
      they are interested. Otherwise they are not. Sometimes people are direct too. They try to
      cut me off and steer the conversation towards another topic.
                                                       rs
   4. What’s the influence of modern technology such as internet, emails on our communication?
      I think they have increased the overall communication but at the same time they have also
                                                    e

      decreased face to face communication. Moreover, they have reduced the importance of
                                              tt


      language and grammar in communication. People care more about being concise rather
      than being grammatically correct.

                9. Describe an expensive activity that you enjoy doing
                   occasionally
           You should say

               -   What it is
               -   Who do you do it with
               -   Why is it expensive
               -   And explain how you feel about it

               •   My main hobbies include streaming movies, reading novels and listening to music.
               •   So, most of hobbies are actually quite economical.
               •   But occasionally I like to go for river-rafting at Rishikesh.
               •   I generally go there with my friends and cousins.
               •   Unlike, my other hobbies, it is rather expensive as the trip costs about Rs 30,000.
               •   First, travelling costs amount to about Rs 5000.
               •   Then, there is accommodation and food cost, which is about the same.
               •   The rest of the it is the river rafting charges.
               •   I started doing river rafting about three years.
               •   One of my friends experienced it and he couldn’t stop talking about it.
               •   So, during summer vacations that year, three of my friend and I went for river rafting.
               •   I love the river rafting experience for several reasons.
               •   But I think the most important reason is that it is thrilling and exciting.
               •   It gets my blood pumping and I feel so alive when I do it.
               •   I don’t know swimming and I think that adds to the feeling of danger.
               •   Another reason why I love river rafting is not about river rafting but rather that the fact that
                   I get to spend time with friends.
               •   The whole experience takes us about two days and one night.
               •   During this time, we talk, play games, pull pranks on each and enjoy delicious meals
                   together.
               •   We have so much fun that time passes away very quickly.
               •   That’s why I think we have made it a yearly tradition, which we eagerly wait for.
               •   If it were cheaper, we would have done it more often, but then it would have reduced its
                   charm as well.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions


   1. What kind of expensive things do people like to buy?
      I think it varies from person to person, but generally expensive things people buy involve
      clothes, technological gadgets like mobile phones and cars and motorcycles. The most
      expensive product that I own is an Apple computer.

   2. What the difference between men and women in buying things?
      I don’t think there is a major difference today. However, men sometimes make extravagant
      purchases like a costly watch or a mobile phone. Women, I think make purchases after
      careful consideration.




                                                                   m
   3. What are advantages and disadvantages of being rich?
      I think the biggest advantage of being rich is that you can prioritize your health and fitness
      over anything else, while poor people sometimes have to sacrifice their health for money.




                                                                o
      The biggest disadvantage of being rich is that people are always ready to fleece you. People
      don’t feel guilty about cheating a rich person.

   4. Why are some of the sports expensive? Are they for everyone?
                                                     rs
      Some of the sports especially adventure sports are expensive because they require licenses,
      trained professionals and expensive safety equipment. No, I don’t think everyone can afford
      them. Also, they are not for the faint of heart because of the risk involved.

           You should say
              - What it is
              - How you learned about it
              - Why are you interested in it


                •   I find nearly all the different streams of science like biology, physics and chemistry very
                    difficult.
                •   But one area that really interests me is astronomy.
                •   As with many sky enthusiasts, my interest originated in childhood.
                •   I don't remember the exact moment, but I do remember being very interested in space in
                    third grade, when I was about seven.
                •   I remember that there was a presentation in my school on stars.
                •   I came back home and told my mother that I thought this was great stuff.
                •   Soon I could recite the names of the planets faster than anyone in the class, which for some
                    reason was very important to me.
                •   I used to love to sleep outside at night so that I could look at the stars.
                •   My fascination with space kept growing with age.
                •   I think my interest stems from my curiosity to learn more about the universe and the solar
                    system.
                •   Are there aliens? or Are we alone?
                •   Is there any other planet where we can survive or is Earth the only one?
                •   Space has endless mysteries and there is so much we can learn from the study of space.
                •   I am not a big movie buff, but I never miss a movie on space.
                •   I think I have watched Interstellar ten times now.
                •   I also love to watch you tube videos on space by famous astronomists.
                •   I am very interested in buying my own special telescope once I start earning.


           Or

                •   Science is very important in a student’s life.
                •   It’s through the science subjects that we begin to think logically and find answers to our
                    questions.
                •   I found all the aspects of science interesting, like physics, biology and chemistry, as these
                    sciences answer everyday questions about why things happen and how we evolved.
                •   Today I will be talking about a science, which I find the most interesting.
                •   It is computer science.
                •   I remember that I started becoming interested in it when we started with the computer

   •   The lab sessions were always enjoyable, but our teacher taught it in a very interesting way
       and we all enjoyed the theory lessons a lot too.
   •   There are many interesting things that I have learned from this science.
   •   The first thing is how we can use computers not just as a source of entertainment, but it’s use
       is much more vast than that.
   •   It can be used to organize and plan things at home. It can be used for many other day-to-day
       activities like, banking, research work, shopping, connecting with friends and relatives and so
       on.
   •   Not only that, it helps the artists creates new art and helps designers create clothes, cars,
       buildings, etc.
   •   Another reason that I have an interest in this science is because I know that in every field
       today we need to use computers.
   •   It will help me with my higher studies and also in my career later.




                                                                    m
   •   In this contemporary world, the computer science has become an important science and it is
       essential that everyone is computer savvy to be able to do well in their studies or work or
       even if it is used as a source of entertainment.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions


               1. What’s the best invention in the past hundred years?
                  I think there are many inventions which have transformed our lives, but I think invention of
                  internet has had the maximum impact. Today, we have endless information available at our
                  fingertips and we can communicate with anyone sitting anywhere.

               2. What’s the influence of science on human life?
                  I think there are two main influences of science. First, science brings logic and reasoning in
                  human life. It reduces the impact of superstition and makes us more open-minded and
                  accepting of others. Second, science and inventions have made our life much more
                  comfortable as compared to the past.

               3. What can individuals do for scientific research?
                  I think most science inventions happen accidentally. Individuals see a need and they come
                  up with an idea to address that need. That is how, new inventions take place. Individuals can
                  also donate money to scientific organisation to fund scientific research.

               4. What influence can international cooperation in science bring about?
                  There main challenges to scientific research in today’s time is the lack of funding and lack of
                  access to information. International cooperation can address both of them. If countries
                  share funds and their knowledge, scientific research would definitely receive a boost.

    11.       Describe a prize that you received
You should say
   - What it was
   - When you received it
   - What did you do for it
   - And explain how you felt about it

•   I have always believed in working hard and not worrying about the outcomes.
•   But I would be lying if I said that I didn’t actually care about prizes.
•   When I was in school, I took part in an inter-school quiz competition.
    But, just before the inter-school quiz competition we had our mid-semester exams.
•   So, I couldn’t really pay much attention to competition.
•   Despite that, I came first in the competition and received a gold medal.




                                                                      m
•   And this made it all the more special.
•   The quiz was on different topics from science to match to general knowledge.
•   I went into the competition with no expectation of winning.




                                                                  o
•   I just didn’t want to embarrass myself.




                                                             .c
•   But, two things worked in my favor.
•   My general knowledge has always been good because I read the newspaper daily.
•   I don’t even skip reading the newspaper on exam days.
                                                       rs
•   It is a part of my daily routine.
•   I couldn’t specially prepare for the other topics, but a lot of the topics were similar to my
                                                    e

    school topics.
•   So, when I was preparing for my school exams, I was also in a way preparing for the quiz.
                                              tt


•   I still remember the day of the exam.
•   I woke up on the day feeling really nervous.
                                           a




•   In the first round of the quiz, I answered one question, then another and then another.
•   At that time, I felt I was just lucky.
                                     M




•   But by the third and fourth round, I felt a lot more confident.
•   One of other participants was also very good.
                                   S




•   In the last round, it was a like direct competition between both of us.
•   However, I came on top by a slight margin.
                          LT




•   Immediately after the competition, I was awarded the gold medal.
•   I remember feeling very happy with all my teachers and peers congratulating me.
•   It was all so surreal.
                     IE




•   I still get emotional thinking of that day sometimes.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
               1. What kind of prizes do students get?
                  I think the main prize that students receive are for topping the exams. Besides that there are
                  various competitions in schools like sports competitions debate competition, quiz
                  competition, dance and singing competitions, which entail prizes.

               2. Should students get the same prize in sports and academics?
                  I think yes, sports and academics are the same in my eyes. I think they both have their own
                  importance. Therefore, a student who excels in sports should be awarded the same way as
                  students who excel in academics.

               3. Why should people be awarded?
                  I think awards are foremost a recognition of a person’s efforts and hard work. They also
                  build a spirit of competition. In other words, awards make people more motivated and work
                  harder. I think very few of us are self-motivated and awards act as an external source of
                  motivation.

               4. Are awards always good for the winners?
                  No, I don’t think they are always good. They can also create a feeling a superiority among
                  the winners that they are better than others. This in return, can also create a feeling a
                  complacency among the winners and stop them from working with the same level of
                  dedication and commitment as they did before.

    12. Describe a time when you first talked in a
      foreign language
You should say
   - Where were you
   - Who you were with
   - What did you talk about
   - And explain how you felt about it

   •   I think the first time I talked in a foreign language was when I was in 3rd grade.
   •   It happened at school.
   •   My English teacher made me speak about myself in English with another classmate.
   •   I had learned about English alphabets in kindergarten and I could even write simple
       sentences in English by that time.




                                                                   m
   •   However, I had never spoken a sentence aloud.
   •   So, I was really nervous.




                                                               o
   •   My teeth were clattering and my whole body was shivering.
   •   It took me a lot of time to think what I should talk about.



                                                          .c
   •   Eventually I think I talked about name, my hobbies, my parents name and their profession.
   •   I think it was a short three sentence introduction.
                                                     rs
   •   My teacher guided me and corrected me whenever I made a mistake.
   •   The first sentence took me more than thirty seconds but as I spoke more, I got more and
       more comfortable.
                                                  e

   •   After each sentence my other classmates clapped and that also boosted my confidence.
                                             tt


   •   After my turn, my teacher made all the other students do the same.
   •   She made pairs and made everyone come to front and talk about themselves.
   •   I could see that everyone went through the same feelings as me.
                                          a




   •   My other classmates were also nervous like me, some of them were even sweating.
                                    M




   •   But after speaking, we all felt so much better.
   •   I couldn’t wait to reach home and tell my mother how I spoke in English.
   •   Gradually, I got more and more comfortable with English.
                                   S




   •   But that first time I spoke in English, is something I can never forget.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
               1. At what age should children start learning a foreign language?
                  With regards to learning a foreign language, I think the earlier the better. So, I think primary
                  school is the best stage to start learning foreign language. Young children have less
                  inhibitions and don’t hesitate while speaking. Also, there is a lot of burden of studies in
                  secondary school.


               2. Which skill is more important speaking or writing?
                  I think both are equally important. A few years ago, I would have said that speaking is more
                  important, but with the coming of internet we have started communicating in the form of
                  emails and chats and so writing today is equally important.

               3. Does a person still need to learn another language if he is good in English?
                  I think learning another language is always beneficial. Bilingual children are better at
                  multitasking and thinking out of the box. Learning another language also helps in the mental
                  development of children. I think I have read it at many places that bilingual children
                  outperform monolingual children academically.

               4. Do you think minority languages will disappear?
                  Unfortunately, yes. I think it is already happening. There are many reasons for it, but the
                  primary reason is English is prioritized in most of the countries as it gives a competitive
                  advantage in jobs. Moreover, linguists around the world are also not doing enough to
                  protect the minority languages. There is research into minor aspects of languages like
                  English and French, while minority languages are completely ignored.

               2. Why do people make decisions?
                  People make decisions to feel in control. Decisions give us a feeling that we are the masters
                  of our fate. No one else can control our fate. Decisions also give direction to our life. Every
                  decision has a consequence and it takes our life in certain direction.

               3. Can children take decisions on their own?
                  Yes, I think even children can take decisions on their own, but I also believe their likelihood
                  of making a mistake is higher than others as they are worldly-wise. Thus, parents should
                  take decisions for children when they are young and gradually as they grow up, allow them
                  to take decisions on their own.

               4. When do people change their decision?
                  I think changing a decision is all about our conscience. When we get that feeling inside that
                  we have made a mistake or we are doing the wrong thing, we try and change our decision.
                  And if we don’t change our decision, we always feel guilty about doing the wrong thing.

    14. Describe an event you attended in which you
      didn’t like the music played
You should say

   -   What the event was
   -   Where you were
   -   What the music was like
   -   And explain why you didn’t like the music.

   •   I love listening to music.
   •   In fact, I listen to music while cooking, while cleaning and even while studying/working.
   •   And I generally enjoy all genres of music from pop to rock to jazz.




                                                                    m
   •   But few years I attended a concert by Sunidhi Chauhan, and I didn’t enjoy it one bit.
   •   There were mainly two reasons for it.
   •   First, Sunidhi herself didn’t show up.




                                                                o
   •   I was and still am a big Sunidhi Chauhan fan and it was a great disappointment.
   •   The greatest singers of the world could have come to the stage and I would still have been



                                                           .c
       disappointed.
   •   I was really looking forward to hearing Sunidhi live for the first time.
                                                      rs
   •   So, I was very disheartened.
   •   The second reason was the backup singers seemed like amateurs.
                                                    e

   •   They didn’t involve the crowd at all.
   •   Their performance was very dull and monotonous.
                                             tt


   •   I didn’t feel like I was attending a live performance at all.
   •   In fact, after a while, none of us were paying any attention to the songs being played.
                                          a




   •   The music was also too loud, and it was hurting the ears.
       I remember many people asked the event managers to lower the volume of the
                                    M




   •
       loudspeakers.
   •   What added insult to injury was that the event managers refused to refund the money.
                                   S




   •   Some of the people even fought and got their money back, but I was too tired to fight then.
   •   I left the concert quite early.
                         LT




   •   More than anything else, I never got an opportunity to hear her live again, I don’t know if I
       will get an opportunity in the future too.
   •   It might remain a dream.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions

               1. Why do so many young people spend a lot of money on concerts?
                  I think it is mainly because of the experience. Hearing a singer on the screen can never
                  match the feeling of hearing them live. Also, I think it’s about spending quality time with
                  friends.

               2. Do you think older people like the same music as young people?
                  I feel young people like pop, rock music, basically any music that they can dance to. They
                  don’t care about the lyrics; they care more about the fast beats. Old people are more into
                  soft, slow, music. They actually pay more attention to the lyrics.

               3. Do you think music concerts are suitable for old people to attend?
                  I think it might be physically taxing for the old people to stand for so long at a concert. But
                  otherwise, I think if the old people can manage the physical exertion, the concerts are
                  certainly suitable. Today many concerts also offer chairs, where the older people can sit and
                  enjoy the show rather than having to stand.

               4. Why do shopping malls often have background music?
                  I think the music is there to enhance the experience of shopping. We remember shopping
                  through not only sight but also through music playing in the background.

      time
You should say
   - What it is
   - What you did for it
   - When can you achieve it
   - And explain why you have this ambition

   •   I have had ambitions in my life.
   •   Some I have achieved and some I have failed to achieve.
   •   I have always felt the reason for my failure to achieve a goal has always been associated
       with my lack of motivation.




                                                                    m
   •   So, today, I want to talk about ambition that I am really motivated to achieve.
   •   The ambition is to settle in Canada.
   •   I think it all started about five years ago, when one of my close friends, Ravi moved there.




                                                                 o
   •   Before that, I was completely unaware about the life in Canada.
   •   His words have built a fairytale image of Canada in my mind



                                                            .c
   •   He told me about the difference in the quality of life between India and Canada.
   •   The healthcare and the education system in Canada are miles ahead.
                                                      rs
   •   There is no corruption, there is very negligible crime and more than anything else there is
       value for labour.
                                                   e

   •   Then, Canada’s weather is also to my liking, as I hate the heat.
   •   I sweat profusely during the summers in India and it makes not only makes me
                                              tt


       uncomfortable but also others around me.
   •   Canada’s summers are also quite cool.
                                          a




   •   I also have a habit of googling pictures from Canada and the beautiful landscapes have only
       strengthened my resolve to settle in Canada even more.
                                    M




   •   That is reason I am taking the IELTS exam today.
   •   You can see that my English is not great, but I have worked really hard to improve my
                                   S




       English for the past few months.
   •   It was not easy.
                          LT




   •   I have developed the habit of watching English movies and reading English newspapers for
       developing my English.
   •   I also try and talk with all my friends in English and even ask them to do the same.
                    IE




   •   I know only practice makes perfect.
   •   I have also done research on the course and the university I want to apply to.
   •   Even if I fail today, I will try again- because I am really motivated to fulfil this ambition.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
               1. What kinds of ambition do people have?
                  I think ambitions vary with age. In school student’s ambitions is to get into a good college or
                  a university. Some youngsters with a creative mindset also dream about becoming a
                  successful celebrity or a successful singer. As people finish their education, the ambition is
                  to get a high-paid job in reputed firm and then after children, children’s ambitions become
                  the parent’s ambitions too.

               2. Why should parents encourage children to have ambitions?
                  I think ambitions give direction to children. It makes sure they are dedicated and less likely
                  to fall off the track. Moreover, if children are ambitious they are less likely to fall down on
                  failing. They are always willing to try again.

               3. Should parents interfere with children’s ambitions?
                  I think if parents interfere with children’s ambitions, it would create a feeling of resentment
                  among the children for the parents. It would have disastrous long-term consequences for
                  their relationship. I think parents should be supportive of their children’s dreams, but they
                  can encourage them to keep backups and not put all their eggs into one basket.

               4. Is there any difference of ambition of grown-ups and that of children?
                  I think grown-up’s ambitions are much more realistic than children because they know that
                  life is full of problems and hurdles. Children, on the other hand, sometimes have very
                  unrealistic ambitions. Children also don’t get much disheartened on failing to achieve their
                  goals, while adults sometimes even go into depression on failing.

You should say
   - When it was

   •   I have changed my opinion about different things.

       factually correct and which contradicts with my previous beliefs.

   •   But when I entered 10th grade, my history teacher opened my eyes to the wonderful world
       of history.                                   rs
   •   She related each historical event with a situation at present.

       could better handle a particular situation.

   •   She also threw light on our common Indian traditions and their origins in history.
   •   It made me realize traditions are much more than just superficial customs practiced for
       pleasing elders.
                                          a




   •   Some traditions actually have scientific backing for example water is stored in copper
                                    M




       vessels as the copper ions dissolve in water and purify the ions.
   •   With each class my interest in history and my opinion about history being useless, changed.
   •   Now rather than opposing history education, I ardently support it.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
               1. Do children like to change opinion?
                  I think they do but it is hard for them. I think children are more emotional than adults and
                  this means that they form opinion based on emotions. Emotional decisions in turn are very
                  hard to change because it hurts our ego when we change them.

               2. Why do people change opinion?
                  People change opinion when they find contradicting evidence against their previously held
                  opinion. If they don’t change, they suffer from guilt and thus although they may resist at
                  first, they slowly do change.

               3. Who do young people turn to for advice?
                  I think young people mainly turn to family or figures of authority like teachers and school
                  counsellors for advice. Some youth also turn to their peers for suggestions. Whom they turn
                  to for advice depends upon the matter concerned and the decisions relevance in their lives.

               4. Do people like giving opinion about politics?
                  Indian people are very opinionated when it comes to politics and they are not shy in
                  expressing their beliefs as well. And I think this is good because this means people are
                  politically active and they are thinking about governments decisions and policies. This also
                  means they put a value on their vote.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions

               1. Are most intelligent people happy? Why?
                  Not necessarily. Intelligent people have high expectations of life. They may feel unhappy if
                  things don’t go according to their expectations. But, at the same time i think it is difficult to
                  generalise. Intelligent people know that happiness is a state of mind, and so they may try their
                  best to stay happy.

               2. Do you think intelligent people are selfish?
                  No, selfishness has nothing to do with intelligence. I think it is personal nature to be selfish. A
                  person who is intelligent may get success in his life and may seem to be selfish, but actually
                  he is not. Even people who are not so intelligent may be selfish. It is basic human nature to
                  look after one’s own interests first. So, it cannot be said that intelligence makes people selfish.

               3. Do you think intelligent people are helpful?
                  Well, a helpful nature also has nothing to do with intelligence. Anybody can be helpful, but
                  intelligent people can help in better ways with their intelligence. People who are not
                  intelligent but have money can help by giving money, but intelligent people can help by
                  educating the poor.

               4. Who do you think plays a more important role in children’s education, parents or teachers?
                  Why?
                  Well, both have a vital role in children’s education. The role of both parents and teachers is
                  different, but equal. So, it is difficult to say, who has a greater role. In social education, parents
                  have a greater role, but in academic education, teachers have a greater role.

               5. What qualities do you think a good teacher should have?
                  A teacher should have good communication skills. Without good communication skills, a
                  teacher cannot teach well. Secondly, he should have depth of knowledge of the subject. Then,
                  he should be impartial. He should have no bias towards the rich or poor students. He should
                  be able to come down to the level of the student to teach well.

               6. How do teachers help children in their education?
                  Teachers help in all possible ways. They work hard to provide good academic knowledge to
                  the students. They have to keep themselves up-to-date with the latest syllabi and teach
                  students according to the requirement of the time. They can also do some career counselling
                  and advise the students any career path according to their aptitude.

               7. Why are some children more intelligent than others?
                  It can be because of genes. Some may be born intelligent. Some children may work hard to
                  achieve that level of intelligence.

               Yes, Indian people do like to take photos of themselves. Selfies have become very common

              Some people like to keep photos because photographs are mirrors of the past and they want to

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions

               1. Do people nowadays help others more than in the past?
                  There have been helpful people in every era and they use the means they can to help others
                  in need. I believe that people have more means to help other people anywhere in the world
                  because of technology. That was not possible in the past.

               2. Who should teach children to help others? Parents or teachers?
                  Both parents and teachers share the responsibility to ensure that the children learn to help
                  others. Parents should be role models for their and teachers can have lessons and activities
                  in schools to inculcate/imbibe this value/virtue in children.

               3. In what kind of professions do people help others more?
                  I think in all professions people help other directly or indirectly through their products and
                  services. However, those working in the social/community service fields, like NGOs working
                  to promote child education, women empowerment, and other such social issues, help
                  others more.

               4. Why are some people willing to help others?
                  People who are empathetic, sensitive, and compassionate are more willing to help others.
                  These values are what they have seen and learned from their parents, teachers and other
                  people around them while they are growing up.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions

               1. What rewards can children get from school?
                  Children can get rewards in the form of certificates, medals, words of appreciation in the
                  classroom or assembly or in the form of notes written to parents. Some other prizes that are
                  given in schools are books, stationary, and gift vouchers.

               2. Should parents push their children to get prizes?
                  I would say that the parents should encourage their children to participate in competitions
                  and give it their best efforts. They should make their children understand that if their efforts
                  are sincere, the rewards will follow. Inculcating a sense of competition is important, but
                  making children over-competitive can have some repercussions.

               3. Is it good for children to compete for prizes at school?
                  It is good for children to compete for prizes as it gives them an opportunity to test their
                  abilities and skills. It also teaches them the importance of putting in their best efforts. Prizes
                  can act as a motivation for many students to participate in competitions and that in turn
                  helps them recognize their talent.

               4. What kinds of rewards can companies offer to their outstanding employees?
                  Companies can offer rewards to employees in form of certificates, vouchers, bonuses, and
                  other gift prizes. Some companies also offer gifts like holiday packages, etc.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions

               1. Do people in your country like to read books?
                  Yes, people of my country like to read books. There are bookshops in most towns and cities,
                  which are all doing good business.

               2. What kinds of books are most popular in your country?
                  All types of books are very popular. India is a diverse country. People have diverse tastes in
                  everything, including reading.

               3. Do you think reading is important?
                  Yes, reading is very important. It develops imagination and also develops language skills.

               4. Do you think electronic books will eventually replace paper books?
                  Not completely, but to a large extent yes. E-books have a lot of advantages

                   Benefits of e-books over traditional books
                   Easy to carry while traveling
                   Need less storage space -
                   Less costly
                   Immediate purchase -
                   You can do font adjustments.

               5. Some people like to collect books. Why do you think they do this?
                  They do so because they love books. They treat books as collectibles, and are proud of their
                  collection.

               6. Is compulsory reading (in school) is a good idea?
                  Yes, definitely. In order for students to achieve in math, science, English, history, geography,
                  and other subjects, reading skills must be developed to the point that most of them are
                  automatic. Students cannot struggle with word recognition when they should be reading
                  quickly for comprehension of a text. But the ability to read and write develops with careful
                  planning and instruction. Children need regular and active interactions with print.

                   Reading is a Good Workout
                   Just like muscles, the brain benefits from a good workout. And reading is more demanding
                   than watching TV or listening to the radio.
                   Reading Builds Vocabulary
                   While reading books, especially challenging ones, you will find yourself exposed to many
                   new words you wouldn’t be otherwise.
                   Reading Helps Self Esteem
                   Another one of the key reading benefits is that the more you read, the more knowledgeable
                   you become. With more knowledge comes more confidence. More confidence builds self-
                   esteem. So it’s a chain reaction.
                   Reading Improves Creativity

       of the brain.

   7. What books do children read and what do adults read?
      Children read fantasy, fiction and books on supernatural characters like Barbie, Superman
      and Shaktiman. Adults read biographies, fiction and religious and spiritual books.

   8. Why men and women prefer different books?
      This is because they have different tastes.

   9. Why some books become internationally popular?
      This is perhaps because these receive a lot of publicity.




                                                                      m
   10. What type of books children read nowadays? What type of books did children like reading in
       the past and what do you think they will read in the future?

                                                                  o

                                                             .c
       50 years ago – Children read a lot. They read moral and spiritual books. They read animal
       stories. After 50 years – I do not think they will do any reading. All the time will be spent in

       No, I don’t think that children have lost their interest in stories. However, the stories they
                                              tt


       read today are very different from those in the past.

   12. Can storybooks be an ideal gift for children?
                                           a




       Yes, definitely! Storybooks can be an ideal gift for children. They can help the child imagine
                                     M




       the characters in the mind, which is the first step to creativity. Another important benefit is
       that we can impart the knowledge of culture, tradition, moral values and religion in the
       mind of the child. This forms the basis of the child’s personality. Finally, storybooks enhance
                                   S




       the curiosity of the child and enhance their mental growth.

                   •     It is a movie that shows that today’s younger generation may appear to be aimless and
                         carefree but given the right direction and guidance they can achieve wonders.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

1.     Do people like comedy?
       Yes, people love to watch comedy as it is a great source of entertainment. Also, in today’s
       world where everyone has to work really hard, comedy acts as a great stress buster.
       Personally, I love to watch comedy series on Netflix. My favourite comedy series is a US
       based sitcom called Friends.

2.      Why do people of all ages like cartoons?
       People of all ages love to watch cartoons because they are really funny and enjoyable. Kids
       like watching cartoons because they are fun and they can learn many things from them.
       Cartoons are fantastical, so they could think their dreams are coming true by cartoons. For
       adults, cartoons take them back to their childhood and provide breaks from their hectic

3.      Why do some people like to make others laugh?

       I think there are 2 main reasons why some people like to make others laugh. First, when
       they make others laugh it makes them look more attractive, especially to the opposite

       gender. For example, women like men who have a humorous nature. Secondly, it helps
       them to break the ice or remove the tension in a nervous situation.
                                                      rs
4.     Should teachers tell jokes in class?
                                                   e

       Yes, teachers should definitely crack jokes in a class. It would help them to develop a
       stronger bond with their students and also it could be used as a tool to explain some
                                              tt


       difficult concepts to the students. Also, the students will not be scared of their teachers and
       will respect them more.

               •   India went into lockdown in the last week of March.
               •   It was a shock for all of me as I had never faced or even imagined such a situation.

               •   I was at home with my family.
               •   I thought it would be over soon and I will be back in daily routine soon.

               •   During the lockdown no bookstores were open.
               •   I just kept thinking, I will start preparing once the lockdown is over and things start.
               •   However, the government kept on extending the lockdown and I just passed my time watching movies,
                   playing mobile games.
               •   I had a big list of things I wanted to learn – like baking a cake, 3 D origami etc.
               •   If not study, I could have learnt them.
               •   And to be honest, I knew that a lot of material for IELTS was available online.

               •   It would have been the best time to study.
               •   I really wish I would have utilized that time more productively.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. How can we avoid wasting time?
      I think the best way to avoid wasting time is to make a schedule. Also, another thing we can
      do is to engross our self in work. Only if we are free, we can waste time. We should always
      keep doing something in our free time. In other words, we should never be free actually.

   2. Is time management important?
      Yes, time management is really important. I think there is only resource that we can never
      get back and that is time. And there is no bigger regret in life than wasting time.

   3. Should parents help children manage time?
      Yes, in the beginning yes. They can make a timetable for them and make sure they follow it.




                                                                   m
      If children develop such a habit at young age, it stays with them for life.

   4. Do you think relaxing is a waste of time?




                                                                o
      No, I don’t think relaxing is a waste of time. However, relaxing should not be doing nothing. I
      feel relaxed when I do things I love. Just sitting idle is a waste of time. It is better to do

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. Where can people hear a lot of noise?
      People can hear a lot of noise at public places like bus stations, railway stations, malls and so
      on. Moreover, in big cities, there is a lot of noise on the roads during traffic because of
      honking. In India, religious places also use loudspeakers and thus there is a lot of noise
      there.

   2. What may happen when someone listens to very loud music using headphones when they
      are running or hiking?
      I think in the long term, it might cause permanent damage to ears. Moreover, it may also
      lead to accidents as people while running might not hear car horns due to loud music. So, I
      would not consider it to safe to put on loud music in public places.




                                                                     m
   3. What can be done to reduce traffic noise?
      I think government can make strict rules about honking and unnecessarily honking should




                                                                 o
      be considered a traffic violation. Also, car engines start making noise after a few years, so
      people should be encouraged to replaced car engines after a few years.

   4. Do you think the world will be noisier in the future?
                                                      rs
      On the contrary, I think the world would be quieter because people are becoming less social
      than before. I think noise is mainly made in social situations. More and more people are
                                                   e

      becoming introverted and thus I think noise would also reduce for this reason. Also
      governments have also made strict rules about noise and thus noise would reduce in the

               •   It is an adventurous water sport.
               •   There are many other water sports like deep sea diving, jet ski, para sailing etc but I want to

                   well.
               •   I want to try this sport because I have never tried adventure sports in my life and this water
                   sport sounds really exciting to me.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. Which is the most popular water sport in your country?
      According to me, the most popular water sport in my country is White Water Rafting. One doesn’t
      need to know swimming to do this sport. One has to wear a life jacket and be seated in the raft. The
      adventure level in moderate and it also includes calm sailing sections too.

   2. Why do people like to do things near water?
      Water is a necessity and serves the purpose of adventure and recreation too. People like to camp and
      have a bonfire near water. They enjoy fishing and having parties near the coast. The scenic views
      around water during sunrise and sunset are pleasant and soothing.




                                                                          m
   3. Do you think schools should teach students to swim and why?
      Absolutely! Schools should teach students how to swim. It is not just a complete workout, it is a life




                                                                      o
      skill that can help students in moments of need and emergencies.

   4. Are there many schools teaching swimming?
      Not many, but some of the good schools do teach swimming now. To teach swimming, schools have
                                                          rs
      to invest a lot of funds and space to build a pool and hire a good instructor. It isn’t possible for many
      of the schools.
                                                       e

   5. Why should water transport be developed?
                                                 tt


      Water transport plays an important role in worldwide trade. There are many goods which are imported
      and exported through water transport. Also, cruise ships have become an important part of tourism
                                             a




      and their popularity has risen in the recent years. It gives people an opportunity to not only travel to
      new places but also to explore the marine life.
                                       M




   6. Do you think it is necessary for everyone to learn how to swim?
      Yes, I think swimming is an important skill that everyone should learn. It helps us stay physically and
                                   S




      mentally fit. And for some people, especially those who live near a water body, it is an important life
                           LT




      skill.

   7. What is the difference between outdoor sports and indoor sports
                     IE




      The main difference between outdoor and indoor spots is the physical activity. There is more physical
      activity in the sports played outdoors compared to most sports that are played indoors. Another
      difference is that most indoor games are played alone while most outdoor ones are played in teams or
      groups. So there is more social exposure and more skills are learnt when playing outdoor sports.

                27. Describe a time when you were surprised to
                  meet a friend.
                    You should say
                         -   Where it was
                         -   Who you met?
                         -   When was it?
                         -   Why were you surprised?



               •   I have very few friends and we are very close to each other.
               •   So, it is not often I get surprised.
               •   However, last year, I got a big surprise when I met one of my friends in Chandigarh at Rose
                   Garden.
               •   I went to Rose Garden with my family during last summer.
               •   We were all sitting on mat, which we had laid out on the grass, and were enjoying a picnic
                   lunch.
               •   Suddenly, I felt someone’s hand on my shoulder.
               •   I turned around and I was surprised to see one of my closest friends Siddharth.
               •   I knew he was in also in Chandigarh, but I never expected to see him at Rose Garden.
               •   He told me that he came to know my whereabouts through the photos which I had uploaded
                   on Instagram.
               •   He was doing some shopping at a mall very close to Rose Garden.
               •   So, he decided to surprise me.
               •   He called my sister to find out, where exactly we were in Rose Garden.
               •   So, actually everyone else knew he was coming, except me.
               •   It was a big surprise for me.
               •   My sister also photographed my reaction when I turned around to see him.
               •   After the big shock, he also joined us for the picnic.
               •   Then, I spent some time at the mall with him.
               •   Not surprisingly, we could only do window shopping.
               •   He still sometimes brings it up by saying that remember the time I surprised you at Rose
                   Garden.
               •   I am looking for an opportunity to surprise him, like he surprised me.
               •   But he is expecting it, so it would be very hard to do so.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. Why do friends meet up?
      I think there are various reasons. The first is to just spend some time together because for
      most people doing things together is more fun than doing things alone. Secondly, I think it is
      just to talk, share and get advice on matters and so on.

   2. Are there any meetings that people need to plan in advance?
      Yes, there are many meetings that people plan in advance like a doctor’s appointment. In case
      of friends also, it is better to take an appointment because the other person might be busy
      with work.

   3. Are there any jobs related to unexpected things?




                                                                     m
      I think there are companies that help people plan surprise parties. So that maybe a job related
      to unexpected things. I can’t think of anything else besides that at the moment. In research
      also, many findings have been unexpected – gravity for example.




                                                                 o

                                                            .c
      Yes, for sure. Like I said before, scientific discoveries happen by chance. The biggest discovery
      I can think of was of the microwave. It was discovered by the scientists while working on
                                                      rs
      something completely unrelated and now we can’t imagine a kitchen without a microwave.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions


   1. What qualities does a person need to have to take care of old people?
      A person needs to be patient when taking care of the old people, because the elderly are like
      children in many ways. It is very important to realise that the elderly may sometimes be hard
      of hearing and so the person should not get impatient or lose temper while taking care of the
      elderly. A person also needs to be a good listener while taking care of the elderly people
      because their main problem is social isolation and they need someone to talk to. One should
      be very polite and respectful towards the elderly.

   2. Do you think old people should be taken care of at home?
      Ideally yes, but if there is a problem at home and both the younger people are working then




                                                                   m
      professional caretakers should be hired to look after the elderly at home or the elderly should
      be left in a good nursing home where they can be taken care of well.




                                                                o
   3. How can people in the neighbourhood help the elderly during an epidemic?
      People in the neighbourhood can help the elderly in many ways during an epidemic. For



                                                           .c
      example, if an elderly couple is living alone then the people in the neighbourhood can help by
      buying vegetables and groceries for them so that they don’t have to go out during an
                                                      rs
      epidemic. They can cook for them and take care of them and help them get timely medical
      aid whenever needed.
                                                   e

   4. Do you see this kind of help occurring in your neighbourhood?
                                              tt


      Yes, there is an elderly couple in our street and their children are living abroad. Now during
      the Corona lockdown, my parents bought vegetables and groceries for them so that they
                                           a




      didn’t have to go out. My father also used to call them daily to ask if they needed anything.

      even maids were not allowed in those days.

               •   We all take risks in our life.
               •   Sometimes we realise we are taking a risk, and sometimes we don’t even realise that we are
                   taking a risk.
               •   For instance, crossing a busy road is also taking a risk and boarding a train which has started
                   is also taking a risk.
               •   In these situations we don’t even realise that we are taking risks.
               •   Here, I would like to talk about a situation when I took a risk and it had a positive result.
               •   I have a pet dog, Nora, whom I take for a walk in the evening every day.
               •   It’s a toy breed, shih tzu.
               •   Our neighbours have a German shepherd, Bruno, which is very aggressive.
               •   Everyone in our street is afraid of that dog.
               •   Even I am very afraid of that dog.
               •   They tell all of us not to be afraid of their dog as it is well trained and would not harm any
                   known person.
               •   But Bruno’s growl is worse than the Corona pandemic.
               •   Normally they keep their dog leashed all the time.
               •   One day, as I was walking in the street with Nora, Bruno escaped and came running towards
                   us.
               •   Nora ran the other side and her leash slipped from my hand.
               •   I knew I had to act quickly and save Nora.
               •   I came between that dog and Nora.
               •   In that one second, I could imagine myself being bitten at several places and blood oozing
                   out from all of them.
               •   It was a big risk, but at that moment the safety of my dear Nora was the most important
                   thing for me.
               •   When I came between Bruno and Nora, I took Bruno’s name in a stern voice and told him to
                   sit.
               •   Surprisingly, he sat still and started wagging its tail.
               •   I heaved a sigh of relief.
               •   In the meantime, my brother had come out and Nora was safe in his arms.
               •   I felt so happy that I was able to save Nora.
               •   So, this was the risk I took which had a positive result.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions


   1. Why do some people enjoy extreme sports?
      Some people enjoy extreme sports because they’re adventurous by nature. They get the thrill
      out of doing challenging sports. Some people also do it for money as there is a lot of money
      involved in such sports.

   2. Are action films popular in your country?
      Yes, action films are very popular in my country. They are especially popular among children
      and young people.

   3. Do you think it is a good thing if a leader likes to take risk?




                                                                     m
      Yes, I think it is a good thing if a leader likes to take risk. Somebody has to take the risk at
      times, and if a leader is taking a risk that means he is excepting the responsibility that if
      something goes wrong he is to blame for it. People look upon such leaders who have the




                                                                 o
      ability and the courage to take risks and do things differently.




                                                            .c
   4. Do you think men and women will make a different choice about risk taking?
      Nowadays, gender differences are disappearing and so are the choices about risk-taking. It is
                                                       rs
      an individual variation. Irrespective of the gender, if a person is daring he or she will take the
      risk.
                                                   e

   5. What about the young and old?
                                              tt


      Generally young people like to take risks, whereas the elderly like to play it safe. It also
      depends on the type of risk involved. If the risk may land a person into some physical injury,
                                           a




      then young people come forward, but if the risk is like investing money then the elderly may
      have more experience and may step forward to take the risk.

                30.       Describe a mistake you have made
               -   What it is?
               -   When you made it?
               -   How you made it?
               -   How you felt about it?

               •   We all make mistakes in life
               •   In fact making mistakes is part of human behaviour
               •   Here I would like to talk about a mistake which I made recently
               •   During the Corona pandemic there was a lockdown going on in all the states
               •   After a few days of the lockdown the government allowed two hours relaxation in the
                   morning to go out and buy vegetables and groceries.
               •   My mother asked me to buy some vegetables from the vegetable market.
               •   I put on my mask, took a tote bag and went out on my scooter to buy the vegetables
               •   When I reached that vegetable market I saw a huge crowd over there
               •   Actually it was the first day of relaxation and so most of the people had come out of their
                   homes
               •   I should’ve come back after seeing the crowd but I made the mistake of going in and buying
                   the vegetables
               •   Social distancing was unavoidable in such a big crowd
               •   I somehow bought the vegetables and returned home
               •   When I told my mother about the crowd she was very angry at me and told me that I
                   should’ve come back.
               •   It was all over the news that because of this relaxation many people had come out and
                   social distancing was not followed.
               •   All the news channels were advising people to take care of social distancing
               •   I felt really bad and I realised my mistake
               •   I felt that the government is doing its duty very well but it is the onus of the people also that
                   they themselves realise what is good for them and avoid making such mistakes
               •   After that my mother has started buying vegetables from the hawkers that come in the
                   streets
               •   The authorities have allowed hawkers to go to the streets and sell vegetables so that people
                   don’t crowd in vegetable markets.
               •   So this is the mistake that I committed recently.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. What can we learn from our mistakes?
      We can learn a lot from our mistakes. Firstly, we learn not to repeat those mistakes. Secondly,
      we learn how to do things in a better way. We also learn that what we think are small mistakes
      can prove very dangerous in the long run. For example, if a person goes out without a mask
      during any infectious disease epidemic, he may suffer from that disease and it may be very
      risky. So not putting up the mask may seem a small mistake but it can have grave
      consequences.

   2. Do children make mistakes easily?
      Yes, children make mistakes very easily. They are very young and making mistakes is part and
      parcel of learning.




                                                                   m
   3. What should parents do if their children make mistakes?
      Parents should guide their children if they make mistakes. They should teach their children in

      a very friendly way so that children are not afraid of telling them their mistakes in future.

   4. How do children benefit from using dictionaries?
      Children benefit a lot by using dictionaries. They can look for the meaning of a word, and even

               -   Where it was
               -   Why you volunteered
               -   How you felt about it

               •   I have not had many volunteering experiences in my life
               •   But recently I got an opportunity to volunteer and I really liked it
               •   In March 2020 when the Corona pandemic started in India our prime minister ordered a
                   complete lockdown in the whole of India.
               •   Many labour class people were jobless all of a sudden.
               •   These people depend on their daily earning for their living and in one blow their source of
                   earning was gone.
               •   There is an NGO in my hometown which advertised through the local Cable TV that they
                   needed volunteers to provide food and other things of need to these workers
               •   My friend and I decided to volunteer for this noble cause
               •   We called the NGO and asked them where we had to come and what we had to do?
               •   They told us that either we could help with the cooking or we could help with the delivery of
                   food packets
               •   We volunteered for cooking, as my parents were a bit sceptical about us going out for
                   delivering food packets
               •   We went for a whole month and cooked food for these labourers from morning till evening
               •   Of course we all took proper precautions and we were always masked.
               •   It was very tiring but it gave us great happiness
               •   I noticed that many people were donating things for these poor people
               •   Every day I saw hundreds of packets of grocery and cooking oil there to give to the poor
                   people who had suddenly lost their livelihood.
               •   For the first time I realised that doing for others gives a lot of mental peace.
               •   I also realised that we keep cribbing for our problems, which are actually very small if we
                   compare them to what so many around us are suffering from.
               •   I’ve started developing empathy for others
               •   I feel very happy about it and it has changed my perspective about life a lot
               •   I have learnt to value what I have and not crib for what I do not have.
               •   I remember that whole week when I used to come home my mother made me go straight to
                   the bathroom and take a bath before letting me in any other room
               •   She also used to wash my clothes and mask immediately
               •   In a way my family also supported me for doing this volunteer work
               •   So this was the volunteering experience that I had recently

Part 3 - Follow up Questions


   1. What qualities are required for being a volunteer?
      As such no special qualities are needed to become a volunteer. The person should just be
      willing to provide his services without expecting anything back in return. It also depends upon
      the type of work. For example, a doctor can volunteer to provide his services free of cost, a
      teacher can volunteer to teach for children free of cost, people can volunteer to do work like
      cleaning the parks or helping the poor people.




                                                                   m
   2. What type of personality does a volunteer has?
      A volunteer has a friendly personality. He is easily approachable by people. He always wears
      a smile on his face. He has good communication skills.




                                                                o
   3. How can companies engaging in volunteering help our society?



                                                           .c
      Companies engaging in volunteering can help the society in many ways. They can help by
      providing funds to schools, hospitals and in many other ways. They can also do tree plantation
                                                     rs
      which would go a long way in improving the environment.

                                                  e

      Yes I think people should volunteer more nowadays. As it is, people are leading self-centred

      lives. So, by volunteering they will be in touch with the community and it will give them a
      purpose in life.

   5. How do modern technologies assist volunteers and volunteering experiences?
                                    M




      Modern technologies assist volunteers and volunteering experiences in a big way. First of all,
      through these technologies young people come to know where they can go out for

               -   and how you feel about it

               •   Apps have become very common since the dawn of the smartphones.
               •   These are special programs, which run on mobile devices and make life simpler.
               •   There are apps for making communication instant and easier, such as Whatsapp, Viber,
                   Facebook app and so on.
               •   There are apps for online shopping such as Myntra app, Amazon app, flipkart app and so on.
               •   In this world we can communicate with our friends with messages, call or video chat.
               •   I have many apps in my phone, but the app I use the most is Whatsapp.
               •   We can be connected with our friends instantly by this.
               •   I heard about this app from my friend Harjot when I was in 10th standard
               •   He had downloaded what'sapp in his android phone.
               •   After he told me, I also downloaded it.
               •   It is a very interesting app.
               •   This app helps us to send messages to our friends and we can also send images and videos
                   to them.
               •   When new version of what'sapp was launched, a new feature of audio call was also added.

                   wait for the reply for a long time.
               •   But with whatsapp our messages are immediately delivered to our friend and we can
                   continue our chat.
               •   The only drawback of this app is that it is very distracting.
               •   The users want to constantly keep checking their messages. Studies are affected. Workplace
                   productivity is also affected.
               •   So, such apps should be used wisely.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. Which phone app is the most popular in your country?
      Many apps are popular in my country. We have the Facebook app, WhatsApp app, zoom
      app, Amazon app mantra app Google Maps app and so many more.

   2. Do you think the parents should limit the time their children spend on the phone?
      Yes, I think parents should limit the time that children can spend on the phone as there are
      too many apps on the phone on which children waste away valuable time. So it is the
      parents’ responsibility to see what their children do with their phones and how much time
      they spend on their phones

   3. Do you think people depend on phone apps too much?
      Yes, I think people depend on phone apps a lot nowadays. These apps are also very useful




                                                                   m
      and save time. For example when people go out they don’t need to ask directions as Google
      maps is there to help them. When people have to pay bills they use the app of their bank
      and use it to pay their bills.




                                                               o
   4. Do you think some apps will help people to study?



                                                          .c
      Yes definitely, there are many apps which help people to study. For example, nowadays
      during the lockdown going on due to the Corona pandemic, teachers are teaching through
                                                     rs
      apps such as the Zoom, Google meet and so on. Then there are also apps such as
      dictionary.com which helps students to search the meaning whenever they need to.
                                                  e

   5. What kinds of Apps do you have on your phone?
                                             tt


      I have many kinds of apps in my phone, such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Amazon, Flipkart,
      Viber and so on. I use these apps for staying connected with my friends and relatives and
                                          a




      also for doing online shopping.
                                    M




   6. What are the drawbacks of having too many apps on your phone?
      There are many disadvantages of having too many apps on the phone. Firstly, these apps
      occupy space. Secondly, when you use too many apps, the battery of the phone also gets
                                   S




      discharged very soon. Furthermore, these apps can misuse your personal information, as
                         LT




      most of these apps can access your personal information from your phone. Moreover, these
      apps can fill our mobile devices with lot of spam. Finally, you need to update these apps
      from time to time.
                    IE




   7. How much time do you spend on these Apps?
      I spend a lot of time on apps. These are very addicting. Even though, sometimes, I resolve in
      my mind not to use them very often, I cannot resist the temptation, and once I open any
      app, I end up wasting a lot of time.

   8. Do you like to look for new Apps or just keep using the old ones?
      I like to look for new apps, but as my phone has limited space, I download and install an app,
      after seeing and discussing all its features with my friends.
   9. Do you use free APPs or the ones that you need to pay for?

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
               1. What will cars be like in the future?
                  What the future has in store no one can tell, but as far as I can see there will be cars running
                  on alternative sources of energy. Already we have cars which do not use petrol or diesel and
                  run on electricity. However in future we may see cars running on solar power, biodiesel or
                  other alternative sources. We may even see flying cars.

               2. What's the difference between men’s and women's preference on cars?
                  Gender differences are disappearing nowadays, and there is hardly any difference in men’s
                  and women’s preference on cars. It is an individual preference. Some people like bigger cars
                  and some like smaller cars. Some people like sports cars and some like luxury cars. For
                  within the city use, people prefer small cars and for long drives people prefer big cars. Both
                  men and women like all types of cars.

               3. What are the differences between bicycles and private cars?
                  There are a lot of differences between bicycles and private cars. Bicycles are cheaper, in fact
                  much cheaper than private cars. Bicycles do not require any fuel to operate. Bicycles help
                  people to remain healthy as riding a bicycle involves some form of exercise. Riding a bicycle
                  also does not require any license. Cars, on the other hand are helpful when the whole family
                  has to go out together. Cars are especially helpful when there are elderly or disabled people
                  at home. Cars are also useful in adverse weather conditions. Cars are safer than bicycles
                  especially where there are no separate lanes for bicycles.

               4. Why do people like to have private cars?
                  People like to have private cars because they are very comfortable to go from one place to
                  the other. They are very helpful when there are elderly or disabled people at home. They
                  are very helpful when the whole family has to go out together. They are also helpful in
                  adverse weather conditions. Finally having a private car is a status symbol.

               5. What are the differences between bicycles and private cars?
                  Bicycles are eco-friendly vehicles. These are cheaper and also good for our health. But cars
                  are better when we have to travel long distances. Cars are also better when weather
                  conditions are harsh outside, such as rain or storm. Cars are safer than bicycles. Bicycles are
                  safe only if there are separate lanes for bicycles.

               6. Is it a good thing that everyone has his/her own cars?
                  It is definitely not good if everyone has his/her own car. Already there is too much
                  congestion on the roads. If every person will have own car then there will be parking
                  problems and traffic jams and too much pollution.

               7. How to buy private cars in India?
                  It is easy to buy a car in India. You have to go to a showroom and pay the money and buy a
                  car of your choice. Easy monthly instalments are also available. Some people also go for
                  bank loans to buy a car.

   8. Do many families own private cars in India?
      Yes, many families own private cars in India. Now, the car has become very affordable.
      There is a car to suit every pocket. For example, Tata Nano is called the poor man’s car.




                                                                   m

                    by pollution
               -   Where is it
               -   When you visited this place
               -   What kind of pollution you saw there
               -   And explain how this place was affected

           (Sample answer)
              • Well ma’am/sir pollution is a big problem these days.
              • There is hardly a place, which is absolutely pollution free.
              • Here I am going to talk about a city, ‘Ludhiana’ which is very polluted

              • I went there last week
              • In fact I go there quite often as my relatives live there
              • Ludhiana is the industrial hub of Punjab
              • Industries dump their effluents in the surrounding area and this causes water pollution
              • The population of Ludhiana is far more for its size and this has given rise to slum areas in the
                 outskirts
              • The people in these slum areas are mainly labourers who have migrated from other states
                 to work in the factories.
              • They too litter the place.
              • There are many vehicles also which cause air pollution.
              • Ludhiana is the richest city of Punjab.
              • Most families have more than one car.
              • Earlier, when I used to go to visit my relatives, I had no problem in finding a parking space
                 for my car.
              • But, now finding a parking place near their home is a big problem.
              • Because of air pollution, people also suffer many respiratory problems.
              • My uncle is also suffering from chronic cough, which is because of the air pollution.
              • A lot of noise also comes from the industries.
              • Whenever I come back from Ludhiana, I heave a sigh of relief.
              • Phagwara is relatively pollution free
              • There is so much air pollution in Ludhiana that my eyes start watering whenever I go there.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. What kinds of pollution are there in your country?
       All kinds of pollution are there in my country, like air pollution, water, noise and soil pollution.
       The major causes of air pollution are exhaust from the vehicles and the factories. Factories
       are also a major cause of water pollution as they release the effluents into water bodies. The
       vehicles on the roads and also various other reasons cause noise pollution, like from loud
       speakers used at celebrations.

   2. What can individuals do to protect our environment?
      Individuals can contribute a lot towards environment protection/ There are a lot of measures,
      which can be taken at an individual level. People can keep their surroundings clean by not
      littering and greener by planting more plants and trees. The use of non-renewable sources
      can be reduced. Practices like reusing and recycling can help immensely towards protecting




                                                                        m
      our environment. For short distances, people should use an eco-friendly mode of transport,
      like a bicycle or they can walk, rather than using a vehicle. The use of plastic can be reduced
      greatly at an individual level and we should not buy things which have too much of packaging.




                                                                    o
   3. Do you think individuals should be responsible for pollution?



                                                              .c
      Yes, individuals have a responsibility towards the pollution caused. The major pollution
      caused is due to individuals, through vehicles. So, it is an individual responsibility to cause less
                                                         rs
      pollution, by reducing the use of private vehicles and using the eco-friendly modes of
      transport or public transport more. Also, to mitigate the effects of pollution individuals should
      plant more trees and shouldn’t litter their surroundings.
                                                     e

   4. Why is there a need to involve government in environmental protection?
      The government plays an essential role in environmental protection. To ensure that the
                                            a




      individuals and factories/industries do not harm the environment, there have to be rules and
      laws implemented by the government. For example, recently in Delhi, the state government
                                       M




      implemented the odd/even car rule, which every citizen followed and it has helped reduce
      the pollution in Delhi.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. Who is the head of the family in your culture?
      In my culture the head of the family is generally the oldest male member of the family. In
      most parts of India there is a patriarchal society.

   2. Are men better at decision making in a family?
      There are no gender differences as far as decision-making is concerned. Generally the
      decisions are made by the oldest male member in the family in patriarchal societies, but as
      far as the ability to make decisions is concerned I believe there are no gender differences and
      women are as good as men in making decisions.

   3. Do you think that in future there will be more women leaders?




                                                                      m
      What the future holds in store for us no one can tell and so it is difficult to say whether they’ll
      be more women leaders in future. However, as women are coming up in all fields shoulder to
      shoulder with men so maybe in future we will see more women leaders.




                                                                  o

                                                             .c
      Yes definitely, a leader should discuss with his team members while making decisions, but the
      final decision should be at the leaders discretion.

               •   She invited us over for dinner at her home.
               •   Honestly speaking I thought that a meal at home was not a great idea of a birthday
                   celebration.

               •   Her mother had decorated the drawing room with balloons and buntings and also prepared

               •   That day she had prepared Chinese dishes because Rania knew we all loved Chinese.
               •   The table was very well laid.
               •   First she served us sweet corn soup.
               •   It was yummy.
               •   Then we had noodles and cheese chilly and Manchurian.
               •   Believe me ma’am/sir that was the most delicious Chinese meal I had ever tasted in my life.
               •   All of us were practically licking our fingers.
               •   For dessert there was a plum cake which was also baked by her mother.
               •   Rania told me that her mother bakes many types of cakes.
               •   I also learnt a few recipes from her.
               •   Rania’s father has a great sense of humour.
               •   We enjoyed his jokes throughout the dinner.
               •   After dinner we played some music and danced and enjoyed a lot.
               •   So this was the dinner I enjoyed the most.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. Why do people like to have special food on special occasions?
       People like to have special food on special occasions to make those occasions memorable
       and to enjoy with friends and family.

   2. What is the difference between eating at home and eating out on special occasions?
      There’s a lot of difference between eating at home and eating out on special occasions.
      While eating at home the hosts are busy in the kitchen and serving food but while eating out
      there is no such pressure on the host and everybody enjoys with each other. However, while
      eating at home one is sure that the food is fresh and according to taste. Eating at home is
      also very economical.

      Every country is cuisine reflects its culture and traditions. Sometimes the cuisine is very
      different in different parts of the same country also. For example, north Indian cuisine is
      very different from south Indian cuisine. So every nation reflects its identity from its cuisine.

      For example if we eat pizza and pasta we know it belongs to Italian cuisine. If we eat cheese
      chilli and Manchurian, we know we are eating Chinese food.

               -   How you feel about it
               -   Why you have interest in this company


               •   There are many large and successful corporations in the world today like Google, Reliance,
                   Amazon and so on.
               •   The company I want to work in is Tata Industries.
               •   Tata Industries is a large Indian origin multinational with many subsidiaries like Tata
                   Consultancy, Tata Motors, Tata Hotels and so on.
               •   Actually, it even has ventures like Tata salts, Tata water purifiers.
               •   In India, everyone knows about it, because in every sector, they have some presence.
               •   Recently, it got global recognition too, after its takeover of the failing Jaguar Motors and
                   converting it into a profitable business within a year.
               •   Admittedly, it is not as commercially successful as some of other multinationals, but still it is
                   my dream company.
               •   There are many reasons for it.
               •   First of all, it is one of the few companies, which doesn’t run after money only.
               •   It runs my social welfare projects like Tata Hospitals, Tata Children Charity, Tata Welfare
                   Homes and so on.
               •   During the coronavirus crisis, it donated the largest amount to PM cares fund in India.
               •   Not only that, it was the first company to announce the donation.
               •   The second reason is it’s work culture.

               •   He told me that Tata Motors is one of the few companies which doesn’t exploit their
                   employees.
               •   The employees are encouraged to maintain work life balance.
               •   In fact, employees are strictly forbidden to work more than 48 hours in a week.
               •   During the coronavirus lockdown, it was one of the few companies, which paid their
                   employees fully.
               •   Last but not last, it would be a matter of pride for me to work for a large Indian company.
               •   Unfortunately, there are very few large Indian origin multinationals.
               •   Over the years, Tata Industries has not only grown domestically, but also spread its roots in
                   other parts of the world.
               •   Tata Industries can help me fulfil both my dreams, I can settle abroad and still work for an
                   Indian company.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. What are the differences between a big company and a small company?
       There are many differences between big and small companies. To begin with, big companies
       offer bigger pay packages than small companies. Secondly, these companies give many perks
       and bonuses from time to time. These companies give benefits like health insurance and
       travel allowance. Another big advantage of big companies is that it is a status symbol to work
       in these companies. Furthermore, they provide opportunities to travel overseas. Moreover,
       in a big company hands on training is provided to all new workers. On the other hand, in a
       small company, everybody knows everybody. You are not part of a big crowd as in a big
       company. If you do some good work, you are applauded for it.

   2. Are there many big companies in your country?
      Yes, there are. India is a fast developing country. There are many Indian companies, which are




                                                                     m
      very big such as Tata, Mahindra, Godrej, Reliance, Videocon, Onida and so on. There are also
      many multinational giants which have opened branches in India, such as Samsung, LG, Maruti
      Suzuki, Hyundai and so on.




                                                                 o
   3. What are the good things about working for a big company?



                                                            .c
      Same as answer 1
                                                      rs
   4. How can a small company grow big?
      Small companies can do so in many ways. They can work hard, employ skilled workers, focus
      on quality and employ good marketing strategies.
                                                   e
                                              tt


   5. Should big companies donate more to charities?
      Yes, they should. I believe that anyone who has enough should help the needy on
                                          a




      humanitarian grounds. Many big companies help the NGOs and NPOs. This is a win-win
      situation for both. When they get publicity for their charity work, they are getting
                                    M




      advertisement for free.

   6. Should big companies be punished more seriously if they break the law?
                                   S




      No, they should not. Law should be the same for all – big as well as small companies. Usually,
                          LT




      big companies have big connections. So, they try to get away with their wrong doings. This
      also should not happen. Punishment should be equally serious for all law offenders.

   7. Are there any big companies in your hometown?
                    IE




      Yes, there are three big companies in my hometown. There is the JCT mail which is a textile
      mill. Then there is a Sugar mill and a starch mill.

   8. Is it difficult to get a promotion in a large company?
      Yes, it is really difficult to get a promotion in a big company. In a big company you are part of
      a big crowd and there are many people in the queue to get a promotion. So it’s very difficult
      to outdo all of them and get a promotion.

                  admire or a person in your family you are happy to
                  know
           -   Who he or she is
           -   What he or she does for a living
           -   What he or she is like
           -   And explain why you admire him or her

               •   In our culture, we tend to admire and respect people for their age.
               •   But today, I want to talk about someone whom I admire not because he is old, but because
                   of his attitude towards life and his actions
               •   The person is my uncle.
               •   His name is Dilmohan Singh.
               •   He is my mother’s brother.
               •   He has held many jobs in his life.
               •   In fact, he started working part-time at the young age of fifteen.
               •   He used to work as a door to door salesman selling magazines at that age for pocket money.
               •   In his adult life, he worked as a bank manager.
               •   Currently, after retiring as a bank manager, he is working as a real estate agent.
               •   There are many reasons I admire him.
               •   The first is his selfless nature. (m@kkarIELTS)
               •   Throughout his life, he has put other’s needs before his.
               •   He has many times postponed his business meetings just for family.
               •   We all say that family should be more important than money.
               •   But he is one of the few people, who actually prioritizes family over wealth.
               •   Another reason why I admire him is that he stands firm in his beliefs.
               •   If he believes in something, he will support it, no matter the cost.
               •   I can see this in how he behaves at home.
               •   He doesn’t mince his words. He calls a spade a spade.
               •   For example, if he thinks that people have done wrong, he will say it straight to their face
                   when his opinion is asked.
               •   He will not try to be polite or lie, just to avoid awkwardness.
               •   Of course, he is not perfect.
               •   He has his flaws too.
               •   For one, he is not very punctual.
               •   In fact, he is always late.
               •   But, despite his flaws, I still admire him a lot.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. Who is important in your family: the father or the mother?
       In my family both are equally important. There is a very harmonious relation between my
       mother and father. Both have different roles and both are equally important. My mother has
       more role in running the family where is my father has more role in earning for the family.

   2. How should parents look after their children?
      Parents should look after the children very nicely. Parenting is a very crucial job and it is a full-
      time job, especially nowadays, in my opinion. Today, children have a lot of exposure of the
      global culture, and they enjoy a lot of freedom. So, parents have to be very alert about the
      whereabouts of their children and treat them in a friendly way, and yet be strict at times.

   3. How should working parents look after their children?




                                                                       m
      Working parents should look after the children very nicely. Whatever time they get, they
      should devote to their children. They should know where to draw the line between work and
      family, otherwise it is very easy for children to go astray and it is very easy for parents to lose




                                                                   o
      hold on the children. Work is important but working parents should realise that their
      children’s childhood is equally important.



                                                              .c
   4. Do children get sufficient love and affection from their parents these days?
                                                        rs
      Yes, children get sufficient love and affection from the parents, but this love and affection is
      substituted by money and not time. Parents think that giving enough money to the children
      is showing their love for them, they forget that what children need more is the time.

   5. What do you think about relationships between teenagers and their parents nowadays?
      The relationships between teenagers and parents is very strained these days. Teenagers want
                                            a




      to follow the global culture whereas parents want them to follow the traditional culture.
      Teenagers want to take up subjects of their choice, such as animation, ethical hacking and so
                                      M




      on, but parents want them to do the traditional courses like engineering, medicine and
      commerce.
                                   S




   6. How do children learn to speak?
                          LT




      Children learn to speak from their parents. They observe their parents and speak as their
      parents teach them to, and slowly they get the hang of the language and learn to speak on
      their own.
                     IE




   7. Do you think adults speak to children differently than between themselves?
      Yes, adults speak to children differently than among themselves. Sometimes they don’t want
      to show their stress or emotions to their children and so speak differently with them, but
      when they speak with each other they have no such inhibitions. When adults speak to children
      they have to consider what to speak, how to speak and how much to speak.

   8. Do you think human communication is different from that of animals?
      Yes, human communication is quite different from that of animals. Humans have a language
      to communicate with each other, whereas animals communicate in their own way which is
      difficult for humans to understand.

               9. What do you think are good communication skills?
                  Good communication skills involve being able to convey what you want to say to the other
                  person without creating any misunderstanding. Good communication involves good
                  command over the language and also good command on body language which involves
                  gestures and expressions.

               10. Do you think everyone can learn these skills?
                   Yes, I believe everyone can learn the skills. Communication Skills is a full fledged subject these
                   days in colleges. However, some people are born with good communication skills and they
                   have a way to communicate their feelings to the other person in a very simple way which does
                   not lead to any misunderstanding.

               11. How would you suggest these skills be taught to children?
                   These skills can be taught to children in many ways. Firstly, parents can be good role models.
                   If parents have good communication skills, children will imbibe communication skills without
                   even being taught formally. Then, this subject can be added in the school curriculum.
                   Nowadays, even in graduate courses like engineering and commerce, communication skills
                   are taught as a subject in the first semester.

               12. Do you think adults and children communicate the same way?
                   No, I don’t think adults and children communicate in the same way. Children are innocent and
                   their communication is plain and simple, which doesn’t involve any twist of words. On the
                   other hand, adults are really careful in what they want to communicate. They are wise enough
                   to know the consequences of the words they use and so their communication is a bit complex.

               13. Can you think of any example of work (or, jobs) that require good communication skills?
                   I think every job needs good communication skills. For example doctors need good
                   communication skills to convey things to their patients; engineers need good communication
                   skills to work as a team to accomplish many projects; hawkers need communication skills to
                   sell their products and so on. Sales personnel need good communication skills.

               14. What (personal) qualities do you think good communicator should have?
                   I think a good communicator should have an amicable personality. He should also be willing
                   to listen, because I believe that a person who can listen to others can also communicate well.

      for your help
   -   When it was
   -   Who asked you for help
   -   How you helped
   -   How you felt about it

       adopted the individualism of the west.
   •   Nearly everyday family members and neighbors help each other.
   •   Today, I am going to talk about a situation when my sister asked me for help.
   •   It’s a little different because she is studying abroad, and thus it is not possible for me to help

       especially on his personal life.                rs
   •   So, she called me and asked me if I could procure her the information.

   •   Certainly, there would be some information available there.
                                               tt


   •   I went there and inquired. M a k k a r I E L T S
   •   The staff told me that there were in fact a lot of books and old newspapers on Bhagat’s
                                           a




       Singh life available with them.
   •   But, unfortunately due to lack of resources and time, they had not been able to upload
                                     M




       these on the internet.
   •   I asked for their permission to scan the pages on his personal life.
                                   S




   •   They were reluctant at first because the books and newspaper were very old and improper
       handling might damage them.
                          LT




   •   However, on my insistence, they allowed me to do so in their presence.
   •   It took me nearly five hours, but I finally found the relevant information.
   •   Then, I scanned it and sent it to my sister.
                     IE




   •   The whole incidence was a big learning experience for me too.
   •   I learnt many things about Bhagat Singh, which I didn’t know before.
   •   When my sister met me, she told me, she was really surprised, how I found all that
       information.
   •   She told me that it was only because of me that she got an A+ in that assignment.
   •   Her heartfelt gratitude made me really happy.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
              1. What can children help their parents with?
                  Children can help their parents with household chores. They can also help in looking after the
                  elderly in the family. They can also help in buying vegetables and grocery. They can also help
                  in attending to guests.

               2. What are the benefits of children helping their parents?
                  There are many benefits of children helping their parents. First, it develops a bond between
                  parents and children. They feel part of a family. It also makes it easier for parents to run the
                  house.

               3. Should parents reward their children when they help others?
                  Yes definitely. If parents reward their children when they help others then children will
                  develop the habit of helping others and this is a very good habit for children to develop.

               4. Do parents help their children because they need their help when they are old?
                  No, parents never help their children for expecting help when they’re old. Parents love their
                  children unconditionally and help them because they think it is their duty and responsibility
                  and not because they expect anything back in return.

      didn’t know about
   -   When did it happen
   -   Who was with you
   -   What did you do
   -   How you felt about it

   •   My sister and I have always liked going on road journeys.
   •   India is a big country and there are so many places one can visit.
   •   So, my parents used to take us to different places in India by car when we were young.
   •   One such time, when we were visiting Delhi, we got lost.
   •   Actually, we were visiting all the famous places in Delhi and eating out at all the renowned




                                                                    m
       places.
   •   That’s what we used to do on our road trips, especially the famous food shops, we never
       missed one.




                                                                o
   •   And there was this famous chhole-bhature shop, which was famous not only in Delhi, but all
       over India.



                                                           .c
   •   Unfortunately, it opened at 5 AM for only two hours in the morning and it sold out in that
       time.                                         rs
   •   To add to it, this place was about two hours from our hotel.
   •   So, we started during the night at 3AM, because both my sister and I didn’t want to miss it.
                                                  e

   •   About two hours later, we were in the middle of nowhere.
   •   I don’t know what happened, but I think somewhere my Dad took a wrong turn
                                             tt


   •   These were the times, when google maps weren’t there.
   •   We couldn’t just put it in google maps and find out where we were.
                                          a




   •   The only ways to know about one’s location and the direction was asking people and looking
       at road signs.
                                    M




   •   And it was dark and foggy, so the roads were empty and road signs were not visible.
   •   At one point, my dad just got off the car and tried to find any landmark to make sense of
                                   S




       where we were.
   •   But there was nothing but trees on either side of the road
                         LT




   •   We were lost.
   •   So, we just sat there, for another hour for the sun to rise and for the visibility to improve.
   •   When it did, some people came out on the roads for morning walk and finally we were able
                    IE




       to find out where we were.
   •   Fortunately, we weren’t that far from the shop.
   •   We had just crossed it along the way by mistake.
   •   We went back and enjoyed the delicious chhole-bhature.
   •   If I had to describe their taste - I would just say they were worth getting lost.
   •   Even now, when I plan to visit Delhi, I always visit that place.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
              1. Do you often get lost?
                  No, I don’t often get lost. Nowadays applications like Google Maps have made it very easy
                  and the people who use such apps seldom get lost.

               2. Is map-reading skill important?
                  Yes, map reading skills are important because it gives you an idea about where you are and
                  you do not get lost. Nowadays, apps such as Google Maps have made things easier and even
                  people who do not have the skill of reading a map do not get lost.

               3. Are some people good at map-reading than others?
                  Yes, some people are better at map reading than others. Everyone has different abilities.
                  What is easy for one person may be difficult for the other.

               4. Why some people like travelling to other places?
                  Some people like to travel to other places because they want to know about those places and
                  the culture of those places. They are adventurous by nature and are curious to know about
                  other people and places.

               5. Should they find information about the place before going there?
                  Yes definitely, they should find information about the place before going there. It is important
                  because, for example, if they know the weather of that place then they can pack the clothes
                  accordingly. They can be well prepared about what to carry with them if they know what all
                  they can do there.

    41. Describe a foreign country(culture) you want to
      know more about?
   -   Which country it is or what culture
   -   Where it is
   -   How you know about it
   -   Why you want to know more about it

   •   I have always wanted to learn about foreign cultures.
   •   I like meeting people from different places, and learning about how we are similar and how
       we are different.
   •   However, there is one culture I have always had a little more fascination with than any
       other.




                                                                   m
   •   It is the Japanese culture.
   •   The main reason is that I like watching a lot of Japanese movies.
   •   Also, in my childhood, I used to read a lot of Japanese manga, which are Japanese graphic




                                                               o
       novels and anime, which are Japanese cartoons.
   •   Even now, I sometimes play some anime series on You tube or Netflix.



                                                          .c
   •   I have found that Japan is different from all others in some ways.
   •   For example, during the 2011 Tsunami, there was no looting, no violence.
                                                     rs
   •   This doesn’t happen even in countries like the US.
   •   I remember when I read it, I found it very strange.
                                                  e

   •   Recently, I read that the reason for it is that morals and ethics are major part of their
       curriculum from primary schools onwards.
                                             tt


   •   So perhaps that is one reason why.
   •   Another thing I read in manga was that there are no maids in schools.
                                          a




   •   Japanese children clean their schools on rotation.
   •   There are these small things, which make me curious to learn about them.
                                    M




   •   On more thing that comes to mind is that they have different shoes for wearing inside the
       house and outside to prevent the spread of germs.
                                   S




   •   Another incident that really raised my admiration was when they refused to sell to India,
       their nuclear technology because they themselves are not using it anymore.
                         LT




   •   They have certain beliefs and they practice such beliefs; they are not just plain words.
   •   Lastly, we also certainly share certain things.
   •   For example, Buddhism, a religion that originated in India is a major religion there.
                    IE




   •   I also know that most of my knowledge about Japan is partial, it is from manga, anime and
       the little bit of news
   •   So, if I get the opportunity, I would definitely like to learn about Japan and its people.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
               1. What do you think is the best way to learn foreign culture?
                  The best way to learn a foreign culture is to go to the foreign country and stay there for
                  some time. It can also be learned from tourists visiting your country. Foreign culture can
                  also be learnt by working in any multinational company.

               2. What do you think is the biggest problem to work in a foreign country?
                  The biggest problem to work in a foreign country is the language barrier. Competing with
                  the local people of that area is also a big challenge. Learning the work ethics of that place is
                  also important.

               3. Some people say that reading is the best way to learn about a culture, Do you agree?
                  Reading is certainly a good way to learn about another culture, but it is not the best. The
                  best way in my opinion is to visit that country and to mingle with the local people and stay
                  there for some time.

   •   Relaxation is important in everyone’s life
   •   Everyone has different ways of relaxation

       fish.

                                                     rs
   •   Last Sunday, I took some bread from home and fed the fish.

                                             tt


   •   It is so relaxing to watch the movements of the fish in the water.
   •   This activity takes away all the physical and mental tiredness away from my body.
                                           a




   •   I feel very light-hearted after that.
   •   Even though there is always a great rush in this temple, yet one can find peace and quiet over
                                    M




       there.
   •   Sometimes, I offer voluntary services in the community kitchen over there.
   •   Free food is offered to one and all in the community kitchen and this service is round the
                                   S




       clock.
                         LT

               1. How do students relax themselves?
                  Students relax by going out with friends or just lazing around at home. Sometimes they even
                  get relaxation by going to the gym. Actually a gym is the place where they release their pent-
                  up energy and then feel relaxed.

               2. What activities do employers organise to help employees relax?
                  Employers organise group excursions for their employees to relax. Some employers also
                  provide gym facilities in the workplace so that the employees can sweat out their stress.

               3. Do people now have more ways to relax than in the past?
                  Yes, people have far more ways to relax than in the past. Technology has given many new
                  ways to spend free time and to feel relaxed. People play online games and chat with their
                  friends across the globe to feel relaxed.

               4. Do you think natural sceneries are more helpful than indoor activities?
                  Yes definitely natural scenery is far more relaxing than indoor activities. Nowadays people are
                  suffering from nature deficit disorder, which means that they are spending less time with
                  nature and more time indoors.

               5. Do you like to visit movie theatres?
                  Yes, I like to visit movie theatres. Once in a month or two I watch a movie in the cinema.

               6. Where do Indian people like to go on weekends?
                  Indian people like to go cinemas, shopping malls, and restaurants on weekends. Sometimes
                  they go to their relatives’ homes

               7. What do old people do to relax?
                  Old people go to religious places. They go to parks and sit on the benches and talk with others
                  of their age

               8. What is the importance of relaxation?
                  Relaxation is very important. It recharges one’s batteries. After relaxing people can work
                  better and students can study better.

               9. What are the ways people relax themselves?
                  People relax in different ways. Some go to parks, some go to religious places, some just sit at
                  home and listen to music or watch TV. Young people have a lot of pent up energy, so they go
                  to gyms and discos to sweat out that energy, and relax.

               10. What do you do to relax yourself?
                   Sometimes I go to the gurdwara. Sometimes I listen to music at home. Sometimes I go to park
                   near my home.

               11. Do you think we should take a day off from our working?

       Yes, we should take a day off from working, because then we can relax and go back to work
       with more zeal and enthusiasm.
   12. Do you think people can actually relax by doing relaxation exercises?
       Yes, people can relax by doing relaxing exercises, such as yoga, and other stretching exercises.
       Exercises also release endorphins, which relieve stress and help to relax.

   13. Some people do nothing to relax. Do you think it is a good idea?
       Yes, sometimes just closing ones eyes and doing nothing also relaxes a person. It depends on
       what sort of activities a person does in routine life. If a person does physical work, then just
       doing nothing can be relaxing. If a person does sedentary work, then other ways of relaxation
       are better.

   14. Do you think relaxation should include some activity or doing nothing is enough?




                                                                     m

       Earlier people went out for relaxation, to parks and for picnics. But today, people go to
       shopping malls and restaurants for relaxation. Young people sweat out their stress in discos

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions

               1. What kinds of quality does a leader need?
                  A leader needs to have good communication skills. He should be able to lead by example. If
                  he wants his team to be punctual he should himself be punctual. He should know how to get
                  work done.

               2. What are the reasons for the failure of teamwork?
                  Teamwork fails if there is no coordination between the team members. Teamwork also fails
                  if the team leader is not very competent.

               3. Do children need to know more about teamwork?
                  Yes, children should know a lot about teamwork, because they have to work in teams at all
                  stages of their life.

               4. Is cooperation more important than competition?
                  Competition and cooperation are equally important. Both competition and cooperation are
                  needed in our day-to-day lives. We need to compete with others in exams, or when we start
                  a new business. We need to cooperate with our colleagues at work, and with other players in
                  the team sports. Children should be taught both - competition and cooperation. They should
                  also be taught where to compete and where to cooperate.

               5. Which one do you think is more important: individual development or team goals?
                  I think both are important in their own way. Individual development is important for the
                  person to rise individually in life. Team goals are important because everything cannot be
                  done alone and one has to learn to march ahead with others.

               6. Do you think it is a good thing to have disagreements within a team?
                  Yes definitely. It is good to have disagreements within the team, because otherwise there is
                  no fun working in a team. You have to learn to accept the good points of the other members
                  and you also have to learn to put forth your views in a team.

               7. How to become a good member of the team in a workplace?
                  A good member of the team respects the efforts done by other team members and at the
                  same time does his efforts honestly so that the whole team goes forward.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
             1. What kinds of films are popular in India?
                Well, India is a diverse country. All genres of films are popular in India. People love action,
                drama, comedy, thriller, romance and many other movies.

             2. Do different age groups like the same kinds of films?
                No, I don’t think so. People from different age groups usually have a different choice in terms
                of the kinds of films they like. For example, the older generation may prefer movies related to
                social and political issues and youngsters may prefer action and comedy movies. I think the
                preference for the type of movies people like, changes with age.

             3. What kinds of films do young people particularly like?
                Young people like to watch movies based on reality or real-life incidents. Superhero and science
                fiction movies are also quite popular among youngsters. Other popular genres enjoyed by the
                young generation are comedy, romance, horror, and action.

             4. Do fewer people choose to watch movies in cinemas than people did in the past?
                No, I don’t think so. These days more people choose to watch movies in cinemas as compared
                to the past. People are leading a very busy and hectic life and going to cinemas to watch movies
                is a popular way that people choose for entertainment and for spending time with family and
                friends. Also, the ever-increasing multiplexes are evidence that people prefer going to cinemas
                despite the online streaming options like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc.

             5. What are other ways to watch movies now?
                Some other ways to watch movies are on TV, through the online streaming websites and apps
                like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, etc. and through DVDs, which, however, is becoming
                less popular.

             6. What's the difference between American movies and movies from your country?
                There are some differences between American and Indian movies. The content of the script is
                one of them. It is more closely related to the respective cultures of these countries. Language
                is one point of difference. Indian movies are made in Hindi, English, or several other languages,
                depending on the region they are made in. However, American films are mostly in English.
                Another point of difference is the technology available and used in films, especially for graphics,
                like in animation and for special effects. Indian films still need to catch up on that and have not
                reached the level of finesse in this area as American films have.

             7. What do you think of violent films?
                I think if the violence shown is not too detailed or graphic, then it is a good form of
                entertainment, especially for action movies. However, if the violence is graphic and explicit,
                then it may lead to consequences like more aggressive and violent behaviour, especially among
                the youth and a feeling of fear or it may traumatize some people.

             8. Why do you think movies need computer techniques?
                The use of computer techniques are vital for animation movies. However, even in the other
                movies it has become important, as it can help incorporate an element of action and excitement

     by showing some stunts that cannot be performed by a person. Thus, also eliminating any
     danger to the stuntmen’s life or reduces the chances of injuries or accidents.

  9. Do you think cinemas will disappear in the future?
     No, certainly not. I think the popularity of cinemas will not fade in the future. People will
     continue to go to cinemas for the experience they offer and for the opportunity to spend quality
     time with their friends or family. The technology available has also made the cinematic
     experience better not only in terms of the content and graphics but also in the viewing
     experience for the audience. For example, the 4D technology has made it possible for viewers
     to feel that they are a part of the movie. I think more such changes will be witnessed in the
     future.

  10. Do you think (watching) films have (has) educational benefits?




                                                                        m
      Yes, it certainly does. Films teach us a lot of things, like about culture, language, history, social
      and moral values and about our responsibilities and obligations to society. There are many
      documentary films that are based on facts and real-life experiences, which also teach us a lot




                                                                    o
      about various subjects and areas.




                                                              .c
  11. Do men and women like to watch the same kinds of films?
      Yes, I think the choice of films is very personal and not based on gender. Some people may feel
                                                         rs
      that since women are more emotional, they like romantic films more while men prefer
      watching action-based films. However, it is not true, as we can see an almost equal proportion
      of males and females in a cinema hall, for any given genre of movies.

  12. In what ways are documentary films and films only for entertainment different?
      The main point of difference between a documentary and entertainment film is that the former
      is always based on facts and reality while the latter may or may not be reality-based.
                                            a




      Entertainment films are mostly based on a fiction based story or script. Another difference may
                                      M




      be that the budget required for a documentary film is lesser than that of an entertaining one.
      Actors are needed for an entertainment film, while in a documentary, mostly non-actors share
      their experiences or knowledge. There may not be a need of an entire film crew like a makeup
                                   S




      artist, cameraman, lightman, etc. for a documentary film. Many people use video cameras or
      these days, only their phones to make a documentary.
                           LT




   13. Why do you think documentary films are not so popular?
     The main reason why documentaries are not so popular is that they are not usually entertaining.
                     IE




     They usually deal with serious topics like social issues, wars, etc. and those based on facts, like
     about the animal species, remote places, etc.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. What measures should be taken to deal with damage on public facilities?
      First of all people should themselves be aware that if they use these facilities nicely only then
      they will be able to use them for a long time. Otherwise, the facilities may be destroyed. The
      government should appoint people for the maintenance of these facilities. Another thing that
      can be done is that a very small fee should be charged for these facilities. That money could
      be used for the maintenance of these places.

   2. What are the differences between old facilities and new facilities?
      Old facilities are like parks and libraries. New facilities are gyms and leisure places.




                                                                      m

   People should wear formal clothes to work and on formal occasions like functions, interviews etc

9. Do people wear formal clothes more often than before?
   I think the trend is changing; people nowadays wear less formal clothes because fashion is providing them
   with abundant options. Even few companies like facebook and google allow people to come to office in
   casual clothes. People find themselves more comfortable in casual clothes.

                47. Describe one of your family members you
                  spend the most time with - m@kkar|ELTS
               -   Who is he/she?
               -   What do you usually do together?
               -   What kind of person he/she is?
               -   Why you spend most of the time with him/her?

               •   If I had to talk about myself, I would say I am very reserved person and it takes a lot of time to
                   become familiar with strangers.
               •   However, I love spending time with my family.
               •   I am very close to both my parents but as we are all working (as they are working and I am
                   studying), its hard for us to spend time together.
               •   The person I do spend a lot of time together with is my nephew- my sister’s child.
               •   He is nearly five years old.
               •   He is very special to me.
               •   There are many reasons for that.
               •   Firstly, everyone says that he looks like me and secondly, we both like spending time with each
                   other.
               •   I think the reason for that is we feel very comfortable with each other.
               •   I get to act like a child around him and I miss being a child.
               •   He is also like me – very shy with strangers and he is very naughty – just like I was in my
                   childhood. Ma kk ar IELTS
               •   So, spending time with him reminds me of my childhood in some ways.
               •   In my childhood, I was in a hurry to grow up but now I sometimes wish I could reverse time
                   and bring back my childhood.
               •   There are so many things we do together.
               •   But something that we really enjoy doing is to play pranks on Deepa, my sister and his mother.
               •   I think we can do that all day long.
               •   We also both love eating chocolates, so whenever we can, we try to buy and eat chocolates
                   secretly.
               •   However, I do get scolded sometimes as I am the adult.
               •   I also have a dog and so we both like playing with her.
               •   We love taking her out on walks and feeding her. M @ k k ar |elts
               •   In the evening, I take my nephew to the park and just spend time on the swings there.
               •   Sometimes, I wish he would always remain a child, but I know that’s not going to happen even
                   if I wish for it a million times.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions


   1. How many generations usually live together in India?
      I think the situation in India is undergoing a change. Earlier joint familes were more common
      and three or four generations used to live together. On the other hand, nowadays nuclear
      families are more common with maximum of two generations living together.

   2. Is it important to visit family members?
      Yes, it is really important to meet family regularly. I think family defines us and family is
      what supports us and stands with us in bad times. However, I think this selfless bond only
      stays if we remain in contact with each other.




                                                                    m
   3. What are the values of family in your country?
      The think the main values of family in India are respect for elders and prioritizing the needs
      of the family over our individual needs. That is why, in India we think in we rather in I, for




                                                                o
      example we own a house, we own this car. m@kK@rI3LTS




                                                           .c
   4. Why is family bonding necessary for happiness in life?
      Family bonding is necessary for happiness because it gives us secure. I mean it makes us feel
                                                      rs
      that we are not alone, there is someone behind us.

   5. Do you think the support from a friend is different from the support from a family member?
                                                  e

      I think certainly. There is an element of selflessness in family relationships, which I feel is
                                             tt


      missing when it comes to support from friends. Also, it doesn’t create a burden. What I
      mean is we do take help from friends but then it also makes us feel that we have to repay it.
                                          a




      This feeling doesn’t come in the case of family.
                                    M




   6. Who should be more responsible for educating the children in a family?
      I think both the parents should be equally responsible. However, I also believe that both
      parents necessarily don’t teach the same things. For example, both boys and girls learn
                                   S




      gender appropriate behavior from fathers, while they love more about loving, sharing and
                         LT




      caring from mother.

   7. Do you think there are differences between how men and women care for children?
      Yes, there is certainly a difference. In India, fathers are generally stricter, and they don’t
                    IE




      show their love openly. Mothers are much more open in showing their love and affection. I
      think it’s hard to define the difference, but I certainly feel there is a difference.

   8. Do your parents do household chores equally?
      Yes, my parents are very particular about the household chores. For example, my father is
      responsible for buying the vegetables from the market daily. He also makes the breakfast
      and tea, while my mother makes the lunch and dinner. I also have the responsibility of
      taking out the trash in the morning and feeding the dog. We have a maid for cleaning and
      other things.

               -   Why was it important
               -   What caused the delay
               -   What happened at the end
               -   Describe what caused the delay


               •   India is a beautiful and diverse country and there are so many things I love about it.
               •   Unfortunately, its public transportation is not one of them, especially trains and buses in India.
               •   Trains and buses often get delayed because of reasons like traffic, fog and other unforeseen
                   circumstances.
               •   Today, I am going to talk about one time when I got delayed because of something unexpected.
               •   My parents and I were travelling to Ahmedabad for my cousin’s wedding, and it was the middle
                   of the monsoon season. (makkarIELTS)
               •   However, we were travelling through Rajasthan, which is one of the drier parts of India.
               •   So, we weren’t expecting any rain, but nature had other plans for us.
               •   It started raining about five hours into the journey and it rained incessantly for hours.
               •   We still thought it was ok and it’s just rain and it would subside sometime soon.
               •   But it didn’t.
               •   In fact, our train stopped at one station because everything ahead was flooded.
               •   A railway official told us that it was one of the worst floods in the state and the railway tracks
                   were submerged under 2-3 inches of water.
               •   I vividly remember one scene when we entered a railway office to enquire when the train
                   would leave.
               •   All the chairs were floating, and the railway officials were sitting on the top of tables.
               •   When we all think about that journey, it is the first scene that comes to mind.
               •   Finally, after hours the train moved again. m@kK@rI3LTS
               •   We missed the wedding, but we did attend the reception which was the next day.
               •   When I think about it, I don’t remember anything about the return journey.
               •   The floods did cause inconvenience, but it also made the journey much more memorable.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. What mode of travel do you consider the safest?
      I think earlier I considered travelling by car to be the safest but because of the increasing
      traffic and road accidents, I now consider train journey as the safest. So, whenever I have to
      travel long distance I travel by train. I also consider air journeys to be safe, but the recent
      airplane disappearances have made me less sure.

   2. How do people travel long distance in your country?
      I think the most common means of travel for majority of the people is train. However, with
      increasing incomes, many people have started travelling by air as well.

   3. How can travelling be useful to people? What do you think people can learn by travelling to




                                                                     m
      other countries?
      Travelling is useful is many ways. First, its one the best ways to meet new people and make




                                                                 o
      friends. Secondly, it enables us to learn about new cultures and traditions. Travelling also in
      a way breaks the monotony of everyday life. There is something very enjoyable about



                                                            .c
      planning a holiday and visiting other places.
                                                       rs
   4. Where, in our opinion, should people visit during the vacations? What type of places do you
      recommend people to visit during vacations?
      I have thought about it a lot. I think people should take vacations at a place, which is different
                                                   e

      from their own native place. For example, I live in the plains, so I love travelling to the hills
                                              tt


      and mountains. People who live in continental locations can visit the beaches. Ultimately
      though, it all depends upon people’s choice.
                                           a




   5. In what ways can society benefit from such members?
                                     M




      I believe there are several ways a society can benefit from such members. Firstly, regular
      travellers can make a society more open-minded by spreading knowledge about other
      cultures. It also builds curiosity among other members of the society to travel. Finally,
                                   S




      sometimes when these travellers like something about other cultures, they might bring it to
      their native place as well.
                          LT




   6. How do you think commercial flights can improve?
      I think the biggest issue with commercial flights today is the lack of leg space, which makes it
                    IE




      very tiring to travel. In fact, sometimes after long journeys all I can think about is lying down
      and sleeping on a bed for hours. Moreover, I think the food prices in aircrafts are really
      exorbitant and I wish these prices are made more reasonable.

               -   Who were the members of the team?
               -   What role did you play in this team?
               -   And explain how you achieved your goal?


               •   I have had both negative and positive experiences while working in teams.
               •   Today, I am going to talk about the best experience I have had.
               •   I think it was because I had a good rapport with the team members and also because the role,
                   I undertook was something I enjoyed a lot.
               •   In 12th standard as a part of the course of economics, our class was given a team project.
               •   My teacher made teams of three members and the team members were selected randomly.
               •   Unfortunately, I did not know any of the other team members in my group.
               •   I mean I knew their names but nothing more than that.
               •   So, I was very apprehensive at the beginning, but it all changed with time.
               •   We were allowed to choose the topic of the project ourselves.
               •   So, we chose the topic of global economic crisis during 2007-2008.
               •   All of us were very curious about what happened for such a big crisis and moreover why India
                   was not very affected.
               •   You can say I was the nerd in the team, so I was given the role of collecting data.
               •   However, both the other team members also helped.
               •   I still remember how we spent every afternoon sitting and reading books on the topic in the
                   library.
               •   We also read some journals on the topic on the internet.
               •   It was during this part that we three became really good friends.
               •   I compiled all the information and then all of it into divided different portions and wrote it
                   down.
               •   The last part of the project was team presentation.
               •   I was really afraid as I found speaking in front of people really daunting.
               •   But my team mates really helped me then. I think we practiced giving the presentation three
                   four times and that made me much more confident.
               •   I think we all did really well in the presentation because only two teams got an A grade in the
                   presentation and we were one of the two.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions


   1. Do you like to work alone or work with a partner?
      I like working alone because I kind of hate being dependent upon other people. However, it
      also depends upon the team members. If I have a good rapport with the team members, I
      find it rather enjoyable.

   2. What kind of people are good to work with?
      The most important quality I try to look for in team members is sincerity. I mean sincerity
      with work. I have unfortunately worked with a lot of people who procrastinate endlessly,




                                                                    m

      Yes, group learning/work is certainly enjoyable because it involves sharing of ideas and
      discussions. Working/Studying alone sometimes can be very boring. However, sometimes it

      distracted.                                     rs
   4. What are the advantages of studying alone?
      The biggest advantage of studying alone undoubtedly is that we can concentrate better. So,
                                                  e

      it is more efficient to study alone. Another advantage of studying alone is the flexibility it
                                             tt


      offers. What I mean is that we can study whenever or wherever we want, and we can study
      at our pace.

   5. What can children learn through teamwork?
                                    M




      The main benefit I feel is children learn how to cooperate and work along with others. This is
      really beneficial in adult life when people have to work together on projects.
                                   S




   6. What are the disadvantages of working in a team?
      I think, firstly, working in a team can be really inefficient because we have to work at
                         LT




      common group speed. Secondly, it sometimes leads to feeling of helplessness if the other
      members are not very sincere about their work and we are dependent upon them to finish
      their work.
                    IE




   7. Is it good to have differences in a team?
      Well both yes and no. Yes, because team differences make sure more time is spent
      deliberating on issues, which means there are less chances of errors. No, because having
      differences means that it slows things down.

   8. What are key skills and abilities needed to be successful in a team.
      I think the main skill required to be successful is the ability to work well with others. People
      should be accommodating, but also not so accommodating that they lose their voice. What I
      mean is that they should be open to ideas of others but also express their ideas and
      reservations about ideas of others.

    50. Describe a goal that you achieved, which was
      set by yourself
Or describe a time when you set a goal and tried your best to achieve it



   -   What it was
   -   When did you set it
   -   How did you achieve it
   -   Explain how it influenced your life

   •   I don’t think I have a strong willpower and many times I set have set goals but failed to achieve
       them.




                                                                     m
   •   But last to last year, I made a new year’s resolution and I made sure I completed it.
   •   In 2018, I took my board exams and I unfortunately I spent a lot of time sitting at home for




                                                                 o
       two to three months.
   •   Because of the lack of physical activity, I gained 5 kgs of weight in those months.

   •   Due to the weight gain, I also lost confidence and stopped talking to my friends.
   •   Thus, I started staying indoor and I gained even more weight.
                                                       rs
   •   So, at the beginning of 2019 I decided to lose all the weight that I gained and regain my
       confidence.
       I mainly did three things to achieve it.
                                                   e
   •
   •   First, I joined a gym and stayed regular with it.
                                              tt


   •   Every day I used to wake up at 6 AM and go to the gym.
   •   I spent about 45 mins to 1 hour at the gym.
                                             a




   •   The second thing I did was to control and manage my diet.
   •   I stopped eating sweets and packaged products.
                                     M




   •   This was really hard for I love sweets.
   •   It was especially hard to give up on chocolates.
                                   S




   •   The last thing I did was to sleep on time.
   •   I could only be regular with the gym if I woke up on time and that meant I needed to sleep on
                          LT




       time.
   •   Earlier I had the habit of binge-watching TV shows and so I used to stay up late at night.
   •   I used to wake up just very late and thus if I did that, I would never have been able to go to
                    IE




       the gym.
   •   I didn’t stop watching TV shows, I just made sure I watched only 1 episode every day.
   •   My gym trainer also told me that proper eight hours of sleep for muscles to regenerate and
       heal so sleeping on time was very important.
   •   After three months of this schedule, I was finally able to lose all that weight.
   •   Doing this made me really confident and I started going out and meeting my friends again.



If you are a bit healthy now – you can say - Unfortunately I have again gained some weight and I am
planning to do this again.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
               1. Do people need to write down goals or simply memorize them?
                  Well I live to write down my goals. It just provides that extra motivation in that weak
                  moment or when we are having a bad day and we feel like giving up.

               2. Do Indian people usually set goals.
                  Yes, many Indian people do. In fact, I remember on 1st of January a lot of my friends and I
                  share our new year goals and resolutions.

               3. Should parents set goals for children?
                  I think parents should motivate children to keep goals, but I don’t think parents should
                  themselves keep the goals. Because I think if children don’t keep the goals, they won’t have
                  the same level of motivation to fulfill them.

               4. When do young people start setting goals for themselves?
                  I think there is no fixed age. It all depends upon the persons maturity and level of
                  responsibility. Some people start keeping goals at a very early age like at twelve or thirteen,
                  while others start keeping goals after reaching adulthood. Goal setting is much more about
                  self-fulfillment and making oneself better and this realization to make oneself better
                  sometimes come early and sometimes late.

               5. What are the kinds of goals that are unrealistic?
                  I think goals which are in tune with a person’s personality are realistic. I mean if I decide to
                  do something which would require me to make a drastic change in my personality, I would
                  not be able to achieve it. So that would be unrealistic for me.

               6. Do young people and old people have different kinds of goals? What are they?
                  I think both yes and no. Yes, in the sense that young people goals are more about achieving
                  something in life, while goals for old people are about helping their young achieve their
                  goals in life. No because sometimes goals can be similar too, for example I see both young
                  and old trying to lose weight and look smart in the gyms.

               7. What is more fulfilling working towards a goal or achieving it?
                  I think both are fulfilling in their own sense. Working towards a goal is about meeting and
                  overcoming challenges, it is about failing and getting back up. Finally, achieving a goal brings
                  a feeling and that efforts did make a difference. However, if we didn’t struggle to achieve
                  something, neither the work we put in nor the final goal brings in fulfillment.

               8. Do you think it’s important to have realistic goals?
                  I think being realistic has its own advantages and disadvantages. Its advantageous because if
                  the goals are unrealistic it is very easy to give up and believe that it was not possible in the
                  first place.It’s also harmful in the sense that we never test our limits. We never try to go
                  beyond. So, I generally set goals to just beyond realistic.

           •   Rohan is my best friend.
           •   He is 20 years old and he is not tall, but looks very handsome.
           •   He has dark curly hair and a dimple on his cheek, which looks very nice when he smiles.
           •   It so happened, that two days before our pre-board exams of +2, we had to submit our physics
               assignment.
           •   We both had prepared our assignments with great effort and were very happy with the end result.
           •   Rohan had bought a new ink-pen, and was trying to write his name on the cover page of the
               assignment.
           •   But, there was some problem with the pen.
           •   In an effort to start writing with the pen, he shook it hard and the whole ink fell on my assignment,
               which was also lying there.
           •   I was on the verge of tears.
           •   All my hard work was wasted.
           •   He also felt bad and said sorry to me.
           •   I could see from his face expressions that he was really sorry.
           •   But, my heart was sinking.
           •   I knew it was not his fault, so I forgave him.
           •   But I also knew that I would have to write my assignment all over again.
           •   Rohan stayed up with me the whole night and helped me in preparing my assignment all over
               again.
           •   It would not have been possible without his help.
           •   The next day we both submitted our assignments and got very good grades from our teacher.
           •   Saying sorry cannot undo the harm, but it can definitely make you feel less bad about things.
           •   My friend tried to cover up for his mistake by first saying sorry and then helping me.
           •   Even today we are the best of friends.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
   1. Is it important to say sorry?
      Yes, it is important to say sorry, because it makes you feel less guilty and you can tell the other
      person that you realize your mistake and would not do such a thing in the future.

   2. In what situations do people say sorry?
      People say sorry when they do something wrong knowingly or unknowingly, and when they
      realize their mistake. They also say sorry when they want to clear any misunderstanding with
      their friend or family member.

   3. Why do some people hate to say sorry?
      Some people hate to say sorry because they have an ego and they think that they would be




                                                                      m
      belittled if they say sorry. Sometimes they don’t realize their mistake. Sometimes they think
      that the other person is at fault and he should say sorry.




                                                                  o

   4. In what situations should we apologize immediately?

      misunderstanding to happen, or when we don’t want our friendship to be broken, or when
      we want our relationship with the other person to be even stronger. For example, in a crowded
      place, when we unintentionally bang into someone or when I forget to switch off my phone
                                                    e

      and it rings and disturbs the whole class, I don’t waste any time in saying sorry.
                                               tt



   5. When do people say thank you?

   6. When was the last time you found it hard to accept an apology?
                          LT




      The last time I found it hard to accept an apology was when my 10 year-old cousin, damaged
      my laptop and I lost all my important documents. I was very dejected, but could not do
      anything about it. My cousin said sorry to me so many times, but I remember I did not talk to

      him properly for two weeks and I have never let him touch my things again.

                52.       Describe an interesting animal
               -   What it looks like
               -   When you saw it
               -   Where you saw it
               -   Explain why it is interesting

           (Sample answer)
               •   India has a diverse animal life.
               •   We have wild animals, domestic animals and pet animals.
               •   Here, I am going to talk about an animal, which I find very interesting.
               •   This animal lives in water but is not a fish
               •   It is a mammal - it is the dolphin.
               •   I came to know first time about this animal from the National Geographic channel.
               •   In fact, this river dolphin is the national aquatic animal of India.
               •   It gives birth to its young one and suckles to feed it
               •   It cannot breathe under water so it has to come to the surface to breathe
               •   Even the little baby has to be pushed to the surface to breathe.
               •   Dolphins feed on most kinds of fish such as the snapper and the tuna.
               •   Dolphins are fast swimmers.
               •   They search their way through the sounds they produce, which is called echo-location.
               •   The dolphins' sound waves hit an object and the echo bounces back.
               •   Most dolphins are peaceful and rather shy.
               •   So far humans have proven to be of greater danger to dolphins than the other way round.
               •   There are marine dolphins found in oceans and river dolphins found in rivers.
               •   Just like the tiger is our national animal and the peacock is our national bird, the Gangetic river
                   dolphin is our national aquatic animal.
               •   The Indian river dolphin is blind.
               •   It is found in the river Ganges.
               •   The female is about 9 feet long and the male about 7 feet long.
               •   Unfortunately our river dolphin is on the verge of extinction.
               •   But now the government has started taking steps to save it under the ‘Project Dolphin’
               •   Dolphins are important for maintaining the ecosystem.
               •   Recently I saw a Hindi movie Ajooba in which Amitabh Bachan is rescued by a dolphin and he
                   considers the dolphin as his mother.
               •   I came to know from that movie that dolphins are very intelligent and can be trained.
               •   So this is the aquatic animal, which I find very interesting.

   Part 3 - Follow up Questions
1. What type of people can be seen on TV? What are the kind of people do the news usually report
   about?
   Many celebrities like actors, singers, sportspersons etc. can be seen on TV. Politicians, subject matter
   experts, bureaucrats, etc. are also seen on TV.

2. Do you think there is too much news about celebrities? What is your take on the news reports in
   recent years?
   Yes, I think that there is too much news about the celebrities these days. News channels mostly focus
   on unnecessary news about famous people, to increase their TRP.

3. Do you think negative information in the news can have negative influence?
   Yes, definitely. The negative news on news channels and in newspapers has a negative influence, as




                                                                          m
   people start feeling that nothing good is happening around them. It may develop a sense of insecurity
   and fear among people, leading to chaos and confusion too, sometimes. Also, people are not aware
   of the news about development, progress and positive events around them, as too little attention is




                                                                      o

4. Why do people like negative news?
   People like negative news because they want to be aware about the wrong happenings around them.
                                                            rs
   They want to be aware of such news, which helps them take precautions for their safety and security.
   Also, it is common to find people more interested in news about disasters, crime, terrorism, scandals,
                                                        e

   corruption, rather than in news about positive developments. I think some people like negative news
   more than positive news because of their pessimistic attitude.

5. What is usually in the news in India?
                                                a




   In India, news is usually about the politicians, celebrities, sports and crime. There are also discussions

                                         M




   developments and discoveries in India and in other countries.

6. Is that information always true?
                                       S




   I would say that the information given on news is mostly true, as sometimes news channels may
                               LT




   exaggerate and sensationalize any news piece, for better TRP. People have access to many sources
   of information these days because of the Internet, so news channels cannot afford to telecast fake
   and false news.
                         IE




7. What’s the difference between broadcasting news in the past and in the present?
   There are many differences between news broadcast in the past and at present. These differences
   are mainly because of technological advancements. These days the news is broadcast real-time. In
   the past, the technology was not that advanced and there used to be a delay before we got news
   from other parts of the country or the world. There are a number of news channels these days from
   all over the world. In the past, there used to be fewer news channels, mostly dealing with the
   domestic news rather than international news.

8. Do you believe everything said in the news?
   Yes, I mostly believe everything said in the news. I usually follow more than one news channel, so

           awareness of people has increased, so the news channels cannot afford to telecast fake or false news.

       9. What kinds of news are popular in India?
          Many kinds of news are popular in India, like political news, news about social issues, news about
          crime, news about celebrities, sports and other national and international famous people.

       10. Could superstars bring positive influence on the public?
           Yes, of course. If superstars have a good image, then they can influence positively. Many people are
           their fans and look upon them as role models. So, if they ask people to do something, people do so.
           For example, if they ask people to plant trees, people would definitely do so. If they ask people to
           abide by traffic rules, people would listen.

       10. Are the stories about celebrities in the news always true? Is the news on celebrities mostly positive?
           No, not necessarily. In fact, most news are exaggerations about their personal lives, and are just
           reported to increase TRP.

       11. How do you think the celebs in the news can influence adolescents?
           Celebs can influence adolescents in both positive and negative ways. If the celebs have a clean image,
           then what they say can influence the young people in good ways. However, if the celebs have a
           negative image in society, then the young people who follow them will follow their bad habits also.

       12. Are news reports on TV in India divided into domestic and international ones?
           I don’t think News are divided into domestic and international ones. However, there are different
           channels for domestic and international news. If any international news is very sensational and likely
           to affect the rest of the world, then it is surely reported along with the national news.

                                              tt


       •   My mother made a nice lunch and many snacks for us and we played carom board

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
               1. Where can people get weather reports?
                  People can get weather reports through Radio, TV, through Internet and nowadays even two
                  apps on their smartphones

                  People change their plans according to the weather reports, especially in the temporary
                  climates, where the weather reports tend to be more accurate. In the tropical climates
                  however, the weather reports I’m not so accurate and so people do not give much importance
                  to them.

               3. What do people do on rainy days and sunny days?
                  On rainy days people like to be indoors and enjoy special dishes such as fritters and tea.

                  Climate change has affected each and every part of the globe, and my country is no exception.
                  Summers have become very long and winters have shrunk. We also have hotter summers and
                  cooler winters.

               5. Does weather affect your mood?
                  When it is too hot I feel very uncomfortable and when it is too cold, I feel lethargic.

   •    Today, we cannot think of a life without the cell phone.
   •    There are many places, where the use of a cell phone is very disturbing.
   •    For example, in religious places like temples, restaurants and hospitals.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions


           1.      What is the impact off the cell phone?
                   I believe cell phones have both positive and negative impact on our lives.
                   Due to the cell phones we have instant access to information and also because of them we
                   can connect with our loved one’s; anywhere, anytime. But at the same time if you think about
                   the negative impacts cell phones have also become a great cause of stress in our lives. The
                   need to always stay connected is taking a toll on our personal lives.

           2.      What is the smartphone used the most for?
                   I think, nowadays the smartphones are primarily used for accessing social networking
                   applications such as whatsapp, facebook and twitter etc. People also use them for Official and
                   Entertainment purpose like checking office email or watching movies and playing games.

           3.      What is your opinion about selfies?
                   I believe, selfies are one of the biggest trends of our era. People are not camera shy anymore
                   and with the advent of front facing cameras on smartphones they are taking selfies for every
                   occasion and at every place they visit.

    57. Describe an important piece of news that you
      received via text message
-       who shared the message with you?
-       what the news was about?
-       how was it written?
-       and explain why the news was important?


    •   Mobile phones have become an important part of our lives.
    •   Even though there are many applications that we use on our phones, calling and texting are
        the two main features that have always been used.
    •   Today I will talk about a time where I received a piece of good news via a text message.
    •   It was from a cousin, Preeti who lives in Australia.




                                                                     m
    •   She is five years elder to me but we used to play a lot in our childhood and I always looked up
        to her.




                                                                 o
    •   She moved to Australia when I was still in school.
    •   At that time we didn’t have mobile phones.



                                                            .c
    •   We used to stay in touch through calls and letters.
    •   Later we both got mobile phones and now we chat or video call one another.
                                                       rs
    •   Last year in the month of May, I woke up and checked my phone.
    •   I had a text message notification on my phone from Preeti.
    •   It was a short simple message about her getting her dream job in one of the best hospitals in
                                                   e

        Sydney. But I was able to almost feel her excitement while reading it.
                                              tt


    •   I was extremely happy to read that message as she had been talking about it for the last six
        months.
                                           a




    •   I knew all the hard work she had put in to first complete her education in that field and then
        get a suitable job.
                                     M




    •   I immediately called her and congratulated her.
    •   She didn’t want to wake me up, due to the time difference, and had chosen to send me a text
        message instead.
                                    S




    •   Everyone in the family spoke to her and congratulated her.
                          LT




    •   It was a very special day and I was happy all day.
    •   I still remember that text message and that day very clearly.
    •   And she is happy at her job and is enjoying it everyday.
                     IE




    •   I am sure she’ll do great in her career and always wish the best for her.




Follow ups
1.     Why do some people dislike sending text messages?
       Some people dislike sending text messages because they feel that it is easier and faster to
       call than typing a text message and then waiting for a reply. Also, sometimes the text maybe
       misinterpreted and may lead to misunderstandings.

           2.      What is the information that cannot be communicated via text messages?
                   Information that is confidential shouldn’t be communicated through text messages. Besides
                   that, in situations that require conveying feelings, emotions or a deeper meaning, only text
                   messages cannot convey that and need face-to-face interaction.

           3.      How do people in India deliver important information?
                   Important information in India is usually communicated through letters and these days
                   email communication has also become quite common to send important information.

           4.      What do you think of traditional paper mails?
                   I think that the traditional paper mails still hold some value in today’s world of technology.
                   There are people who are not very comfortable with technology and prefer paper
                   communication. There may also be people who still don’t have access to technology,
                   especially in remote areas. Also, for personal communication, handwritten paper letters add
                   a personal touch.
                   However, technology has made it faster, convenient, and easier to stay in touch with our
                   family and friends, irrespective of distance. It is also the preferred mode for most official
                   communication.

           5.      Do you think it is still a good way to deliver information using traditional mails?
                   Yes, in certain cases, traditional mails are still a good way to deliver information. There are
                   many people, for example, some elderly people, who are not comfortable using technology,
                   who prefer that official communication be sent to them in the traditional way.

           6.      Have our ways to communicate with each other changed in recent years?
                   Yes, it certainly has. In the past, most of the communication happened through handwritten
                   or typed paper mails. However, now most of the communication is electronic, through
                   emails, chat apps, phone calls, videos calls, etc.

           7.      What are the differences between Indian media and western media?
                   I think that in today’s well-connected world, the differences between Indian and western
                   media are not many. The main difference is that Indian media uses different regional
                   languages to get information across to all the regions and the states, which use different
                   languages. The content is also more suited to India’s diverse culture. At the same time,
                   Indian media also connects us to the world and gives us information and exposure to the
                   whole world, and has elements that are quite similar to the western media. For example,
                   the format of many shows like Indian Idol, India’s Got Talent, news shows and discussions,
                   etc.



           8.      What are the advantages of sending messages via social applications?
                   The main advantage of sending messages via social media is that people can stay connected
                   with their friends and relatives easily. It’s easy to contact others and share information,
                   news, and feelings. Audios, videos, and photos can also be shared through such apps.

       difficult to use at first
    -   What is it?
    -   When you bought it?
    -   What does it do?
    -   Explain how difficult was it to be used?



    •   Last September it was my grandmother’s birthday.
    •   So, I decided to gift her a mobile phone.
    •   I searched on various shops and also searched through the net to make a purchase.
    •   Finally, I decided to buy a senior citizen cell phone.




                                                                      m
    •   It was described that it had big buttons, big icons and not too many functions.
    •   I placed an order with Amazon and this phone was delivered within 3 days.




                                                                  o
    •   When I showed it to my grandmother, she was very happy, and I was also very excited that
        she will start using it immediately.



                                                             .c
    •   My grandmother had never used a cell phone and she was very hesitant to handle it initially.
    •   Many times, she would press the wrong buttons and then feel frustrated with the gadget.
                                                       rs
    •   I also tried to teach her, but this phone was very different from the one that I was using.
    •   Even I had a lot of difficulty getting to know its features.
        The senior citizen version just meant bold buttons and slightly big size.
                                                    e
    •
    •   Nothing else was easy.
                                               tt


    •   So, I had to go through the user manual to explain the functions to her.
    •   I realised It came with preloaded with some books and some devotional music
                                           a




    •   She immediately liked this function and started using it.
    •   Another difficulty I overcame was that I adjusted the light and the font the size to her liking.
                                     M




    •   Gradually she got accustomed to use it.
    •   Now she has started using it and now it has become her favourite pastime.
                                    S




    •   Now I am fully content with the it, because I’ve learnt how to use it and my grandmother also
        has got the hang of it.

•   I am an Avid reader and like to read books on various subjects, like philosophy fiction and science
    fiction.
•   Whenever I travel, I like to carry a book with me and many times it becomes difficult as some books
    are heavy and thick.
•   Last September when I was shopping, I came across Kindle Paperwhite, a gadget by Amazon.
•   It comes preloaded with some books and some others one can buy as e-books at a comparatively
    cheaper cost.
•   I bought it immediately without second thoughts as it suited my requirement perfectly.
•   When I reached home I realised that I had purchased one without a backlight.
•   It needed artificial light to be read easily.

          •   Also, when I tried to flip the leaves it was difficult.
          •   Initially, so very often, I would jump a few pages.
          •   Another difficulty I faced at the initial stages was that it needed some practice to adjust the font
              the size and other aspects of book reading.
          •   But there is no denying the fact that it is the most convenient gadget to be carried when you are
              on the go.
          •   Gradually I got accustomed to it.
          •   Now I can read my favourite magazines and newspapers also on Kindle.
          •   Although I am not fully content with the performance of Kindle reading, specially the particular
              version that I have purchased, yet I would rate it to be a value-for-money purchase.



           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
           1. What type of products are difficult to use at first?
           Goods and products are manufactured for different kinds of people and customers. Some may find
           it difficult to handle a hi-tech machines while some may find everyday use gadgets in the kitchen
           difficult to be handled. Generally products with too many functions and buttons are difficult.

           2. Do you think it is necessary to follow the fashion and use the latest products?
           I would answer yes and no both to this question. Yes! it is good to be up-to-date with the current
           trends and use the new products. One has to change with the changing times and fashion. No,
           because the times today are changing very fast and it is very difficult to keep pace with every changing
           gadget So we should be abreast with the current trends, if not the latest.

           3.Do you believe that some products are over publicized?
           Yes, it is the an era of advertisement and publicity. Anything that is not advertised, slowly fades away
           from memory, like they say... out of sight out of mind. When we watch some television programs
           these days, the intermittent advertisements are repeated again and again and again. So, in terms of
           competition with each other nothing is too much. Sometimes we get fed up of over publicity but that
           is the trick a company plays on human mind.

           4. Why do you think advertisements are useful in selling products?
           There is a whole lot of research and creativity that is behind making an advertisement. If a product is
           for the children then the advertisements are made in such a manner that a child pesters his parents
           on buying that particular brand. Hence the target is achieved. in case of women’s beauty products
           the most impeccably beautiful women are projected and women fall in for that particular product,
           and again the goal is met. So an advertisement is the most useful method of boosting the sale of any
           product.

           5.Which do you think is better buying things online on buying things in real shops?
           Both the methods offer their own advantages and disadvantages. When we buy something online it
           saves time. It also saves fuel moreover it is also economically beneficial as well as it is an eco-friendly
           method. There are also so many discount offers when we purchase online because the online stores
           don't have too many employees and they don't need a shop or a showroom. On the other hand
           certain things like shoes, need to be bought after trying them properly.

6. How do people pay for things they buy online?
There as many payment methods for online shopping. In many cases there is an option of cash on
delivery, when you pay to the person who Delivers the parcel at home. Mobile applications like
Google pay and payTM are popular in India. One can also make a payment directly from the bank’s
debit or a credit card . So anyone who purchases something online opts for the method that is
convenient to him or her.

7. Why are imported products more expensive than locally made products?
Well now the times have changed. It is not necessary that the indigenous products are cheaper than
the imported ones. The Chinese goods are cheaper in India then many of the Indian counterparts.
Many a times the price of a product depends on its quality and quantity. Imported products are
transported overseas through air or containers by the sea route so the cost increases and on many
products there is an import duty when they reach the destination country.




                                                                   m
8. what do you think of those people who only buy expensive things and look down on other people?
We are living in a consumeristic society. The modern generation is very brand conscious. At times




                                                               o
the price of a product is not justified because it is too expensive but the price tag comes with the
brand name. Many people do not like Street shopping and they demean people who do not purchase



                                                          .c
branded products. I think these people live in an artificial world.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
 1.     Do many people know about this company?
        Yes, in my hometown many people know about this company. But as my friend tells me that
        they have business in all parts of India and abroad, so I guess many people know about this
        company even outside my hometown.

 2.     What do you think can be considered as emerging industries?
        Well I guess, emerging industries are those industries which are based on new products or

        hospitality and knowledge.

        Yes, market research is very important for export business. If a person does not do any
        research then the whole thing can go waste and the person can end up suffering huge losses.




                                                                 o
 4.     In business, do companies need to be competitive?

        If their products do not match up with similar products of other industries, then they will not
        have any sale and ultimately will not be able to survive.

                                                   e

        Yes, companies should promote competition, because if they will not do so then they will
        not match their rival companies and will ultimately not be able to thrive.
                                              tt

                                          a




        The government should promote small businesses, because today many multinational
        companies are coming up, and if small businesses are not promoted and supported by the

Part 3 - Follow up Questions

   1. What qualities do you think a good teacher should have?
      A good teacher should have good communication skills, depth of knowledge of his subject and
      should be unbiased towards students. He should also be able to come down to the level of
      student and never lose patience if the student is taking time to grasp something.

   2. Who do you think can learn better? Old people or youngsters?
      I think learn young people learn faster, whereas old people take some time to learn something
      new. But as far as better is concerned I think both can learn equally well provided they have
      the interest to learn.

   3. What do you think is the best age for children to go to school?




                                                                       m
      I think five years is the best age for children to go to school. 3 to 4 would be too early and later
      than five would be too late. So, ideally the best age would be around five years.




                                                                   o
   4. Do you prefer to study by yourself or with friends?




                                                              .c
       I prefer to study with friends because when I study alone I get distracted very soon. Moreover,
       when I study with my friends we can share ideas and that makes study more interesting.

                   -    When and where did you complete/met it?
                   -    Why was it difficult?
                   -    How you felt about it?


               •       I think life would be very boring without challenges.
               •       Challenges not only make life more exciting but also more meaningful.
               •       Today I am going to talk about an assignment in school which challenged me.
               •       The assignment was quite daunting for me, as it involved a group presentation.
               •       And I am very afraid of public speaking.
               •       I am very comfortable when talking with my friends but when I have to talk in front of strangers
                       I choke.
               •       And for that assignment, I had to talk 10 minutes on the environment.
               •       I was really worried and so I went to my uncle who regularly gives speeches in public for
                       advice. m@kkarIElts
               •       He told me that the key to a good speech is mastery over the subject matter.
               •       So, I spent one whole week memorizing the content.
               •       The next thing he told me to do was to divide the topic in different sections.
               •       I divided my presentation into five halves of 2 minutes each.
               •       The first half was for introducing the topic and the last half for concluding the topic.
               •       The remaining three halves were for the main content.
               •       After breaking the speech into sections, I felt a lot more confident.
               •       My friends also knew about my fear of public speaking and so every evening they used to
                       come to my home and help me prepare.
               •       Slowly, I started feeling that it was doable.
               •       I was nervous but I wasn’t worried anymore.
               •       When finally, the day of the presentation arrived, I not only gave the whole presentation but
                       also received an A grade for it.
               •       My teacher told me that I did a really good job and she actually asked me if I had prior
                       experience of public speaking.
               •       That is the day I realized that rather than fearing challenges we should welcome them.

   Part 3 - Follow up Questions


1. Do you think parents should give challenges to children?
   Yes, I really believe parents should regularly give challenges to their children. I think it makes children
   confident and better prepared for adult live, which is full of challenges.

2. What is the most challenging thing for kids?
   I think there are many things which are challenging for kids and it’s hard to single out one. I would
   say making friends is challenging for some, public speaking is challenging for some and for some
   calculations in mathematics are very challenging. It varies from person to person.

3. Can parents reduce the challenges kids have? How?




                                                                           m
   I think they can, but they shouldn’t. If they try to reduce challenges, their child will not become
   independent. What parents should do I feel is to make children understand that challenges help us
   improve and we should not fear but face them head on.




                                                                       o

   I think the major challenge children today face is the challenge of making friends and fitting in.
   Besides that, I feel there is challenge of balancing academics with physical activity. There are a very
                                                            rs
   few children who are able to excel at both physical education and academics nowadays.

               •   India is a densely populated country, so we have lot of places which are often crowded.

                   with people.
               •   It’s called Elante Mall and it is located in the industrial area of Chandigarh.
               •   The mall has total 5 floors which also include 2 levels for parking.
               •   It was built approximately 7 years back and one can find stores of all global brands here.
               •   The mall is mostly crowded over the weekends when people have their weekly offs.
               •   It is a place where no one gets bored as people can do a lot of activities like playing games,
                   watching movies, eating at their favourite restaurant etcetera.
               •   The first time I went to this mall was with my cousins who live in Chandigarh.
               •   It was during the winters and it had been only a month since the opening of the mall.
               •   We had heard a lot about the mall from others and some even said it is one of the best malls
                   in Asia. makk@rielts

               •   We spent almost 5 hours at the mall and didn’t even realise how the time went by.
               •   Now, I am a regular visitor at the mall and I do most of my shopping at Elante mall only.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
1.     Is there a completely quiet place?
       I think that there are not many quiet places in the cities but if one goes to the countryside
       especially the mountain regions one can find lot of places with no noise. In my opinion the
       only quiet place in the cities would be a library, where everyone sits quietly and goes about
       their work or studies.

2.     Do you like to go to the places where there are many people?
       Well it depends a lot on my mood, when I feel like socialising, I like to visit crowded places like
       restaurants and malls. At these places when I see lot of people who are smiling and enjoying
       their time, I get a lot of positive vibes.

3.     Do you like the places with large space?




                                                                       m
       Yes, I like to visit places where there is a lot of space, one can comfortably roam around at
       such places whereas places which are tight make me feel claustrophobic.
       At large places, one’s personal space is not intruded.




                                                                   o

4.     What are the places which attract many people in your country?
       The two places which attract the most people in our country are religious shrines and
                                                        rs
       shopping malls. People in my country just love being at these places and you will always find
       these places crowded.
                                                    e

5.     What do you think is the most important thing of a public event?
                                               tt


       I think, nowadays, the most important thing of a public event is the security of the people
       because in huge crowd things can easily go wrong and lead to mishaps.
                                           a




       Another arrangement that organisers should take care of would be public conveniences like
       drinking water, urinals etcetera. Organisers should also have plans for emergency situations
                                     M




       like fire.

6.     What are the types of problems that can be better solved by group work?
                                   S




       I think all problems can be solved better by groupwork. When different minds work together
                          LT




       on solving a problem, it leads to generation of multiple ideas, which help in solving the
       problem much faster and in a creative manner.

7.     What kind of places do people want to go to when they want to be alone?
                     IE




       When people like to be alone they normally go to their homes and spend time in the comfort
       of their bedrooms. Sometimes people like to go on a long drive or even travel to a different
       city. Being alone gives them an opportunity to reflect upon their problems and think about
       their future or desires.

8.     Why is it sometimes important for people to be alone?
       In today’s world people often get stressed by too many events happening around them. So, in
       order to relax their minds people prefer solitude. It is important for them because being alone
       gives them the time to think about the things that really matter to them and they can focus
       better in their lives.

               •   Nowadays, people have a lot of job options and everyone has a preference related to the job

               •   There are a lot of responsibilities as well and pressure is always high.

               •   My friend is not able to meet his sales targets and always looks worried.
               •   Moreover, one does not get promotions easily in this job, so it does not seem like a great
                   career option to me.
               •   In the past, people used to enjoy working as a salesman, but I think it is really difficult.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
1.     What kind of jobs do young people prefer?
       The young generation likes to do the jobs which involve creativity and where they can work
       independently. They also look for jobs that are well paid and require less physical effort. In our
       country most of the graduates are employed in IT industry. I think they like to work as
       programmers or IT administrators.

2.     Some people will lose their jobs because of technology, how to deal with it?
       I think it is the responsibility of the government to skill these people on new technologies so
       that they can find new jobs. Otherwise there would be large scale unemployment, which
       would be detrimental for the society.

3.     Will you settle down in another country?




                                                                       m
       Yes, if I get a good job opportunity in a developed country, I would like to settle there. I feel if
       a person does not settle early than he or she will never achieve success and will always lead a
       stressful life.




                                                                   o

4.     How do young people today decide their career?
       The present generation has a lot of options when it comes to deciding their career. In the past
                                                        rs
       the young looked upto their family members while deciding their career but nowadays the
       youth have lot of role models from different fields and they make their own decisions. Some
                                                     e

       of them also like to explore different jobs before finalising on one. Moreover, they also do a
       lot of research looking at future prospects of different jobs.

                                            a




5.     Which do young people generally prefer - boring jobs with higher pay or interesting jobs
       with lower pay?
                                      M




       Nowadays the young are intelligent, and they understand if they are not doing something they
       like, they will never be happy. So, they choose the jobs they are passionate about and money
       takes the backseat.

                          LT




6.     Which do you prefer physical work or work involving thinking?
       I prefer intellectual work over work that requires a lot of physical effort. I feel work that
       stimulates your mind is more satisfying as compared to physical work which is monotonous.
                     IE




7.     Do you think today we have less physical labour than we did in the past?
       Yes, today we have to do less physical work as compared to the past. Thanks to the
       advancements in technology, our lives are more comfortable convenient nowadays. The work
       that required strenuous effort in the past can now be done with the click of a button.

                64. Describe a uniform you wear (at your school or
                  company)
               -   When you wear it?
               -   Who bought it for you?
               -   What does it look like?
               -   How you feel about it?


               •   Uniform is very important to maintain discipline in schools or even at workplace.
               •   It also helps in distinguishing between customer and employees or students of different
                   schools.
               •   This is why every place has a different uniform.
               •   I do not wear any uniform now, but I used to wear one in my school.
               •   In fact, in my school we had different uniforms for weekdays and different for Saturday
                   which was the games day.
               •   For the weekdays, the students had to wear white shirt with steel grey bottoms along with a
                   tie, belt and black shoes.
               •   But for the games day, it was coloured T-shirts and white bottoms with the school belt and
                   canvas shoes.
               •   During the winters, we also had to wear a blue coloured blazer with the school motto woven
                   on its pocket.
               •   This was my favourite part of the uniform as I looked really handsome after wearing it.
               •   Also, our school uniform was comparatively better looking as compared to other schools in
                   town, so I felt a little bit proud about it as well.
               •   But I really hated wearing the games day uniform because the white color gets dirty very
                   easily.
               •   My parents used to buy the uniforms for me. MAKK@Rielts
               •   They bought it every alternate year because of my physical growth the old uniforms would
                   get shorter.
               •   I also remember that I used to take great care of my uniform and kept it neat and tidy. This
                   also got me compliments from my teachers.
               •   In the end I would like to say that not many students understand the importance of wearing
                   uniform, but it must be taught to them.

Follow Up Questions


1.     Why should students wear uniforms?
       Uniforms have a lot of advantages. Firstly, it teaches them about discipline and equality which
       are important qualities to learn in the childhood.

2.     On what occasion should people wear uniforms?
       I don’t think people should wear uniform for particular occasion because it would be wastage
       of money. Buying a uniform that one would wear for a single occasion does not make a lot
       sense to me but if people wear it every day in the school or army it serves a better purpose.

3.     Should companies ask employees about the design of their uniforms?
       Yes, companies should definitely do that because when employees will participate in the




                                                                     m
       designing process they will have more respect for their uniforms. They will have a sense of
       ownership and hence they will wear it more proudly.




                                                                 o

4.     Can people tell someone's personality by his or her clothes?
       I think it is very difficult to judge someone’s personality by looking at what they are wearing.
                                                      rs
       Every individual is different, some like fashion and some do not. So a person wearing simple
       clothes could be a highly intellectual person or could be an average guy. We can only find out
       once we talk to them.

5.     What color would catch people's attention most?
       I think the bright colors catch the attention most. Colors like red and yellow normally have a
                                          a




       striking effect. Also, these colors are not worn by many people, so, one’s chances of being the

           13.     Do you think international aid, for example from my national government to another is important?
                   Yes, I think it is very important. It develops good relations between countries. But I think instead of

            Part 3 - Follow up Questions


       1.   In general, how is outside play for children different to playing inside?
            Outside pay is much different to playing inside. There is a lot of physical activity involved when playing
            outdoor games. There isn’t much physical exercise involved in indoor games. Indoor games may not
            include as much social interaction with other players, as in the outdoor games.

       2. Do you think the indoor activities and outdoor activities develop children’s abilities the same way?
          I think the indoor and outdoor games develop children’s abilities in different ways. There is more
          social interaction when children play outdoor games. There is an opportunity to play in bigger teams
          when playing outdoors games, which leads to more awareness of other cultures and backgrounds the
          other children come from. Indoor games may develop better strategic and decision-making skills than
          outdoor games.

       3. What’s the most popular game in India?
          I think cricket is the most popular game in India, however, after the last Olympics, badminton,
          wrestling and gymnastics has gained popularity.

       4. How have games changed in the past few decades?
          Games have changed a lot over the last few years. The format of many games has changed. For
          instance, cricket, football, kabaddi and hockey are now played in the premier leagues format. Also,
          there are many TV channels now that have made many sports popular.

       5. How have children’s game changed in past few decades?
          Children’s games have changed greatly in the last few decades. There are many more options of
          indoor games now since the advent of technology. There are many types of video games available
          now. There is also an option for motion detection in many gaming consoles.

       6. How are children’s games different from adult’s games?
          Children’s games are different from adult’s games mainly in terms of the physical activity involved in
          the outdoor games and as for the indoor games it’s the content of the games that differs and the
          difficulty levels.

       7. Why do many adults not play games?
          The main reason why many adults don’t play games is due to the lack of time. Everyone these days
          leads very busy lives and do not get the time to pursue interests like games and sports.

       8. Do you think modern lifestyles encourage, or discourage, adults from playing games?
          I think the modern lifestyle discourages people from playing games. People are busy with their hectic
          routines and do not get time to pursue hobbies and other pastime activities like playing games.

       9. What benefits do people get from playing games?
          There are many benefits of playing games, both indoor and outdoor. It develops sportsmanship spirit,
          leadership skills, social skills, co-operative attitude, more exposure to other cultures, and many more.
          Sports can also be pursued as a career and it may bring a person name and fame.

10. What benefits can children get from playing games?
    Children benefit a lot from playing games. They remain physically and mentally fit. They learn many
    skills like leadership qualities, social skills, more exposure to different cultures, sportsmanship spirit,
    and many more. This may become a career path for some students later.

11. Do you think group activities (including team sports) can help give a child a sense of responsibility?
    Yes, definitely. Team sports can help a child develop a sense of responsibility. When playing in a team,
    each payer has the responsibility of leading the team towards a win by giving it their best. They need
    to co-operate and co-ordinate with others in the team to ensure that their performance adds to the
    entire team’s performance, and doesn’t hamper it. Similarly, in a group activity, each person has a
    role to play and a task to complete, which helps the entire project to be successfully and efficiently
    completed.

                 67.         A performance you recently watched
             -       What it was?
             -       When you watched it?
             -       Who you were with?
             -       Why you watched it and how you felt about it?


                 •    From my childhood, I have been a very big fan of Punjabi music.
                 •    And my favourite singer is Diljeet Dosanjh.
                 •    Two months ago, I came to know from my friends, who are also big fans of Diljeet, that he was
                      coming to Jalandhar was a concert.
                 •    So, we were all very excited.
                 •    Nowadays, tickets are only sold online and as Diljeet is very popular in Punjab his concert
                      tickets get sold out within minutes.
                 •    We were worried that we might miss it and so the day the tickets were to become available,
                      we all decided to get together at my house as I have the fastest internet.
                 •    The tickets became available at 12 PM and by 12:05 we had booked them and got the
                      confirmation.
                 •    I think that’s when I first felt that I was really going to attend his concert.
                 •    Till then I kept thinking that something might go wrong- for example my internet would stop
                      working or that we would be too slow to buy the tickets.
                 •    Now I just had to wait for the day of the concert and time couldn’t have passed more slowly.
                 •    But finally, the day arrived.
                 •    The performance started at 7.00 PM.
                 •    However, before Diljeet there were two more Punjabi singers. They were really good, but we
                      all wanted to hear Diljeet Singh.
                 •    Finally, he came out on the stage at around 8:00 PM and we all just went crazy.
                 •    I think for whole four-five minutes the crowd kept chanting Diljeet’s name.
                 •    But as soon as he started singing, everyone kept quiet.
                 •    His voice in person was even better than his videos online.
                 •    Another thing I noticed was that even though it was winter, he was sweating so much.
                 •    It made me appreciate him even more.
                 •    All I could wish at that moment was that the night would never end but like all good things it
                      did.
                 •    But still I was one of the best moments of my life and I cannot wait for his next concert.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
1.   What is the difference between watching the performance live and watching it on TV?
     Watching a performance live is an electrifying experience. One can get to hoot and cheer with
     the crowd. Some people just sway their bodies with the beat of the performance, which adds to
     the thrill and joy. However, it is expensive and very time consuming because one has to buy the
     tickets and go to the specific place. On the other hand, one can watch a TV performance in the
     comfort of one’s bed and also see the repeat telecast.

2.   Which do you prefer traditional performance or a concert?
     Both are good in their own way. I enjoy traditional performance especially those of folk singers
     and dancers.

3.   Should government provide financial support to promote traditional performances?




                                                                    m
     Yes, the government should do so. Traditional performers would not be able to survive if the
     government doesn’t support them. If they resort to other occupations, we would not be able to
     see those traditional performances again.

     in any form is good.                             rs

               •   There are many changes that I would like to take place in my community.

               •   It would be the construction of park in my society.
               •   At present, there is no garden or park in our society.
               •   There are many negative consequences of this.
               •   Firstly, the children in the society have no place to play outdoors in the evenings and as a result
                   they spend most of their time indoors.
               •   This I feel has a negative effect on their health.
               •   Sometimes they play on the street, but I feel that is very risky.
               •   The parents are always worried.
               •   Moreover, many of us in the society like to go for morning walk.
               •   Currently we walk on the street but again we have to very careful because of traffic.
               •   A new park would give us a place to go for morning walk.
               •   I think the park would also be a good place to socialize.
               •   We can all spend some quality time at the park specially during evenings after school and
                   work.
               •   There is a vacant government land in the society.
               •   It was not very large, but I think it would be ideal place for a park.
               •   We have already proposed the idea to the local Member of Parliament, and he promised to
                   support and work for our cause.
               •   I am really hopeful that the local administration will soon pick up the project and start working
                   on it.

                         -   Who you were with?
                         -   explain why were you excited?


               •   I am person who easily gets excited and disappointed.
               •   Even small things like watching a new movie in cinema or going out to restaurant gets me
                   excited.
               •   But here I would like to talk about something that made me really, really excited.
               •   It was the time when I went to an amusement park with my niece and nephew.
               •   My niece and nephew live in Canada and they visit India very rarely.
               •   Two years ago, they had come to India with my sister for the summer vacations.
               •   They love going to amusement park but because of summer heat I didn’t want to take them.
               •   It was a really hot summer and the temperatures were touching 40-45 degree Celsius.
               •   I was feeling very upset that I had to turn down their requests for taking them to the park
                   every day.
               •   But one night it rained, and the temperatures came down a bit.
               •   I decided I would get no better opportunity and so I immediately booked the entry tickets to
                   the park online for the next day.
               •   But I wanted to surprise my niece and nephew and thus I didn’t tell them that we were going
                   to the park.
               •   On the journey as well I kept them busy talking with me and hence, they never noticed that
                   we were going there.
               •   I was excited because I knew how thrilled they would be once we reached the park and they
                   were elated.
               •   They never expected it and it came as a huge surprise.
               •   For the whole day, we tried different rides.
               •   My nephew is a bit young and he was afraid, but my nine-year-old niece wanted to try rides
                   even I was bit afraid of.
               •   In the evening, they both gave a huge hug and thanked me for the surprise.
               •   I can never express how I felt then.
               •   I can just say that it was one of most memorable days of my life.
               •   I am planning for another such surprise when they visit me next time.

Part 3 - Follow up Questions


1. Which personal events do people usually celebrate?
      People celebrate personal events like birthdays, marriage anniversaries and even days of
      personal achievements like scoring good scores in a test or doing well on a work project.
      People also celebrate festivals like Christmas, Diwali, Holi and so on.

2. How do people celebrate their personal events?
       I don’t know what others do but, in my family, we invite friends and family for dinner and
       spend quality time with each other. Sometimes we go out to restaurants and sometimes we
       invite people to our home.




                                                                    m
3. How much time people need to prepare for celebrations?
       I think people generally are busy nowadays and for events like birthdays, festivals most people
       do not spend a lot of time preparing. However, for marriages people even spend weeks




                                                                o
       preparing as it a once in lifetime kind of a celebration.




                                                            .c
4. Do you think it is necessary to spend some money on celebrations?
       I think celebrations are about sharing our joys and our excitement with each other. They are
                                                      rs
       about spending quality time with each other. So, I don’t think spending money is important.
       It is about being together and doing fun activities like dancing etc.

           Part 3 - Follow up Questions
           1.      What age will make it difficult for a person to learn a skill?
                   I believe that age is not a factor. Willingness to learn can make a person of any age learn anything.
                   Recently, I taught my grandpa how to use a computer and made his facebook ID. Now he and his
                   computer are inseparable. He is very active on the facebook.

           2.      Will the age of 5 or 20 be better?
                   It depends on the skill. If the skill is stitching clothes, then 20 is better. If the skill is related to
                   technology, the 5 is as good as 20.

           3.      Who will you learn a skill from, friends, teachers or parents?
                   I will learn from anyone who is willing to teach me patiently. I can also learn from the Youtube videos
                   on the net.

           4.      What's the difference between children learning what they like and learning what they have to learn?
                   Children learn very quickly if they like what they are learning. But if they are forced to learn, they do
                   not learn it well, as it is a half-hearted approach.

           5.      Do you think boys and girls should learn the same skills?
                   Yes, I think boys and girls should learn the same skills. There are no gender differences nowadays.
                   Everybody should be free to choose what they want to learn.

           6.      Why do boys tend to have better critical thinking skills?
                   I don’t think there is any difference in the critical thinking skills of both genders. There maybe
                   individual variations but definitely not gender variations.

           7.      Why do girls like shopping?
                   I think everyone likes shopping nowadays. Today, we belong to a consumerist society and both
                   genders like to go shopping.

           8.      Do you like to learn new skills constantly?
                   Yes, I like to learn new skills constantly. I feel very happy when I learn something new. It gives me a
                   sense of fulfillment and inner joy which I cannot explain in words.

           9.      What's the most difficult thing for learning?
                   Difficulty is a very subjective thing. What maybe easy for one person may be difficult for the others.
                   So it is very difficult to say what is the most difficult thing for learning

           10.     What kinds of skills are practical for university students to learn?
                   University students should learn communication skills, as all other skills go waste if the person lacks in
                   communication skills. Students should also learn
                   practical skills because only theory can never be enough.

           11.     Where can we learn practical skills, from?

Part 3 - Follow up Questions
                                                   a




1. Do most Indian people live in an apartment or house?
                                         M




I think it depends on the region they are living in. In most of the big cities, like the metropolitan cities, people
                                      S




live in apartments, as there is a scarcity of land in such places and to accommodate the ever-increasing
population, there are more and more apartment buildings being built. However, in the small cities, towns and
                              LT




the countryside, we can find people mostly living in houses, rather than apartments.

2. Do young people in your country like to live with their parents or by themselves?
                         IE




In my country, young people like to live with their parents, unless they have to move to another city or country,
for higher education or for better career prospects. It’s a part of the Indian culture for children to live with
their parents.

3. Do Indian people like to rent a place to live?

No, Indian people do not like to rent a place to live. I think it’s the dream of almost every Indian to own his/her
own house.

4. Would you live in a foreign country in the future?

                   makkarIELTS Sep-Dec 2020 Speaking Topics


           Yes, definitely. I would like to live in a foreign country in the future. I plan to pursue my education abroad. I
           think there are better education facilities and better job opportunities in developed countries.

            5. How is modern home design in your country different to that of the past?

           The modern home design is very different to that of the past, in my country. The material being used now in
           the construction of houses if much advanced, like weather proof paints, insulated walls, soundproof windows,
           etc. The design of the modern houses is according to the space available. There is better utilization of space in
           the modern home designs. The homes in the past used to be more spacious and not equipped to handle the
           latest electronic gadgets and equipment, like washing machine, microwave, dishwashers & so on.

            6. In your country what type of home do most people live in?

           India is a vast and diverse country. People live in different types of houses, depending on the region and the
           climate in that region. For example, in the eastern parts of India, houses made from bamboo are very common.
           In regions where there is snowfall, sloped houses are common. In plain areas, people design their houses, as
           per the area and space available.

            7. Do people prefer to live in Modern Homes or the older style homes (for example from 50 years ago)?

           People prefer to live in modern homes rather than older style homes because modern homes are better
           equipped to handle the latest electronic gadgets and technology. Also, the material used to build modern
           homes is better, for instance, weather proof paints, earthquake proof design, etc. The modern homes are
           planned better to utilize the space properly.

            8. How are modern homes different to older homes?

           Modern homes are quite different from the older homes, in terms of the design, material used and the
           structure of the building. Older homes were more spacious, with proper ventilation. Modern homes are
           designed to properly utilize the space, due to the shortage of land these days. These days, people employ
           interior designers and architects to plan and decorate their homes. Older homes may not be equipped to
           handle the latest electronic gadgets and appliances.

   1. First set of questions, asked to almost all students

   1. May I know your full name?
      My full name is Kiranpreet Kaur Makkar.
      (Note: Full name means given name + middle name if any + surname. Mostly students will
      speak the name given in the passport, which may not have the surname. So, you must speak
      your full name in answer to this question)

   2. How may I address you?
      You may address me as Kiran.
      (Note 1: Here you may even speak your nickname. It just means that while asking the next
      questions, the examiner will call you by that name.




                                                                    m
      Note 2: Many students start speaking their address here. Here, the word ‘address’ has been
      used as a verb, which means ‘call’. In other words, the question is - How may I call you?)

   3. May I see your ID?
      Here is my passport. (Note: open the first page of the passport and show it to the examiner.

   4. Where do you come from?

                         everyday.

               2. Is it necessary to take a nap everyday
                            Yes it is very important to take a nap everyday because it gives a much needed break
                            to our body and we feel refreshed after sleep.

               3. Do old people sleep a lot? Why
                           Yes old people tend to sleep a lot because due to old age they get tired easily and
                           they need more rest as compared to young people.

               4. What time you usually go to the bed?
                          I normally go to the bed around 11 PM but if I have important work or have to prepare
                          for exams I sleep early so that I can study or work by getting up early in the morning.

               5. Do you always have a good sleep?
                          I am a happy person so I normally have a good sleep, but if I am disturbed about
                          something or my health is not good I find it difficult to sleep.

               66.                Handwriting

               1. Do you think handwriting is still important?
                  Yes, I think so. Handwriting skills will always be important. Formal letters are needed in
                  business. Writing skills are also needed in writing resumes. We all know that we belong to a
                  global village. Today we have to compete with children all over the world. We have to apply
                  for jobs in multinational companies. So we need good writing skills.

               2. Do you think computers might one day replace handwriting?
                 Even though technology has reduced the need of writing skills, still, I feel that it is very important
                 in today’s world and will remain in future as well.

               3. Do you usually write by hand or write using a computer?
                 Well it depends on the situation, if I am sending an email to my friends or texting them then it is
                 usually by computer or mobile phone. When I am studying and making notes then I usually write
                 by hand.

                 The most popular means of transportation in my hometown is the bus. My hometown is on the
                 national highway, and there is bus service to different places every two minutes.

                 as much luggage as you want to, but in planes there is a restriction. Railway stations are there

                 the road, I think people will use public transport more.

prosperity, saffron stands for sacrifice and white stands for peace.

There are no gender differences nowadays. Both men and women wear on types of colors.

season. There are seven colors in the rainbow – violet, indigo, Blue, Green, yellow, Orange and red.
I feel really happy when I see a rainbow. In Hindu mythology, it is called Indradhanush, or the bow of

                                                         rs
It is important to learn a foreign language because it helps you connect with more people. As it is,
today we do not belong to a big planet Earth; we belong to a small global village and to survive in this
                                                     e

global village, it is necessary to be multilingual. For example, English is spoken in 86 countries. If you
know English you can communicate with people of 86 countries.

                                            a




I know English which is a foreign language. It is very helpful for me. Knowledge of English makes me
feel more confident as it increases my communication skills and also it helps me in surfing the net
                                      M




because most websites are written in English.
                                   S




     3. What is the most difficult part of learning a foreign language for you?
I find some pronunciations very confusing at times. For example bough is pronounced ‘bo’ whereas
                           LT




tough is ‘tuff’.
Sometimes the spellings which have silent words also confuse me. For instance ‘b’ is silent in doubt
and debt.
                      IE




   4. What is the best way to memorize new words?
The best way is to start using them in daily life so that they become part of your natural spoken
English.

     5. Is it better to learn a new word from translation or by definition?
I think both ways are equally good. Sometimes some words are learnt best by translation and some
by definition.

   6. Why don’t some people know the language of the society they live in?
This is perhaps because they live in their own shell and don’t intermingle with those people.

                7. What do you think of children learning a foreign language?
           I think children should learn a foreign language. It is very easy for children to learn a foreign language
           as they are very receptive and they are not hesitant about making mistakes. They also have a benefit
           of not knowing any other language too well, to make comparisons and assumptions about the difficulty
           of language learning. In this era of globalization, knowledge of a foreign language is very beneficial
           for a better career and a brighter future. It opens more avenues for the students for higher education
           and good jobs.

                8. Why are some language classes boring?
           Some language classes are boring because of the teaching methods used. If there no interactive and
           fun activities involved in teaching a language and only textbook teaching methods are followed,
           students become bored easily. Incorporating technology in classrooms, keeps the students interested
           in learning and they learn it easily. For example, there should be audio-visual means used.
                9. Some students hate to learn foreign languages, what can teachers do to develop their interest?
           Some students hate to learn a foreign language mainly due to lack of interest and uninteresting
           teaching methods used. Teachers play an important in developing students’ interest. Interactive and
           fun activities should be included to keep the children involved and interested in learning. If students
           are taught only from text books and there is a pressure of examination, it leads to students becoming
           bored or disliking language classes. Teachers should also use contexts and examples to which the
           students can relate in their day-to-day life. If they understand how the language can help and benefit
           them, students would be motivated to learn that language.

                10. Some people travel for learning a foreign language, what do you think?
           I think that traveling is a very good way to learn a foreign language. It is true that the more we use a
           language, the better we get at it. So, if travel to a county/region where that language is used, we will
           interact more with the local people in that language and learn its nuances better. Also, language is
           related to the culture. If we travel, we learn more about the culture and can learn the language better.

                11. What’s the best way to learn a foreign language?
           I think the best way to learn a foreign language in a classroom environment, from a teacher who has
           in-depth knowledge of that language. The teacher should preferably be a native speaker of that
           language or should have a high proficiency level in that language. It is very important to incorporate
           technology and audio-visual methods to teach that language. Also, travelling to that country/region
           where the language is spoken is also a good way to learn it. These days learning a language through
           videos and online classes has become very popular, as the students get a chance to interact with the
           teachers and also with native speakers of that language, through the internet. There are many apps
           also available, which can be downloaded on smartphones, which help learning a foreign language in
           a fun and interactive way. For example, the Duolingo app.

               12. Why can some people learn languages fast white others learn slowly?
           Some people learn language faster than some others because of the teaching methods used to teach
           them. Interacting more with the native speakers also helps with learning a language better and faster.
           Also, there may be a motivating factor, like a job that requires them to learn that language, which
           makes people learn a language faster than others, who don’t have any motivation behind learning a
           language.

   13. Does one’s age affect their language learning?
Yes, I think age affects language learning. I thing the learning curve goes down with increasing age.
Also, at an older age, people try and compare the new language they are learning with the language
they already know. That may cause a hindrance in the learning of a language. People also become
more hesitant about making mistakes and feel more embarrassed, at a later age, as compared to
young learners.

Advantages for children to learn languages – Why it is good to learn languages at younger age
  1. When children learn multiple languages at a younger age, they develop a lifelong love of
      communicating with others.
  2. It is much easier to learn foreign language when young. At a later age it becomes harder to
      become fluent
  3. Learning a foreign language helps a child’s mind develop. Such children do better in other
      subjects. It helps their intellect to develop more

  4. Learning a foreign language helps children to expand their knowledge of the world. They want
      to know about other people and other countries. They would want to understand them instead




                                                                  o

Advantages for the adult learner of a foreign language
He has his own language to compare with the second language. So new terms or concepts are easily
                                                       rs

They have a strong motivation to learn a new language especially if it is connected to an employment
opportunity.
                                                    e

Most adult learners have participated in study earlier, so they know what method of learning works

    2. How do Indian people feel about birds?

India is a diverse country. Everyone has different feelings. Some love birds, and keep them as pets.
Others just admire them flying in the sky. Some even eat birds.

              1. Do any birds have any particular significance in India? For example, does India have a national
                  bird?
           Yes, peacock is our national bird. It is a beautiful bird. The male looks very beautiful with its plumes
           spread out.

               1. Do you think birds should be protected? (Why? / Why not? How can they be protected?)
           Yes, definitely. They are beautiful creations of nature. They add diversity to our environment. Apart
           from that, they are the best pollinators. Also, birds eat insects. That is why crops are protected. They
           are part of our ecological chain. We all know that if any link of our ecological chain is not there, then
           the whole ecology can collapse.
           Birds can be protected by having strict laws against catching and selling birds. The NGOs like SPCA,
           which means Society for prevention of cruelty to animals, and the PFA, which means people for
           animals can also help in this matter.

              5. Do Indian people like raising (keeping) pet birds?

           boat. Boating is done only in places with water such as the Sukhna Lake.

Yes, I like to plan what I do each day. If I do not plan I tend to procrastinate and then all my work piles
up and I start getting stressed.

    2. Please describe your typical daily routine.
I get up at around six in the morning. Then I freshen up and go for a walk. I walk for around 5 km
every day. If for some reason I do not go for a walk, then I feel something is missing from my life. After
coming home I help my mother in household chores. Then I go to school/college. In the evening, I
hang out with my friends for about an hour or so. Then I study for sometime. We are family members
have dinner at around eight. We all watch TV together for about an hour. I go to bed at around 10.

             much about him, but I know that his role in India’s freedom struggle was integral and the British

           5.What kind of chatting app or software do Indian people like to use?
           Indian people like to use chatting apps like, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Hike, V-chat, Viber, etc.


               118.               POLITENESS
               1. 1.      Who teaches you to be polite?
                 Our parents, teachers, relatives, friends and other acquaintances, teach us politeness. We also
                 learn about the importance of politeness from stories we read and movies we watch.

               2. 2.      How do Indian people show politeness?
                 Indian people show politeness in their actions, like talking softly, spending time with the elderly,
                 helping people, greeting others with a smile and many other such small gestures reflect
                 politeness.

              3. 3.       Has the way people show politeness changed in India?
                Yes, I think with the advancement in technology, the way we show politeness has changed. With
                the advent of the internet and social networking, it is very important to show respect to others in
                the way we write messages or emails, so as to not offend others. For example, when chatting
                with someone, it is not acceptable to type in capital letters. It is considered rude and impolite.
              4. Are you angry with people who are late?
             Yes, definitely I am angry with people who are late. I am very punctual myself and I feel irritated
             when somebody keeps me waiting.

              5. Do you think that people have less free time today than in the past? Why?
             Yes, I do feel that people have less free time today than in the past. Today, people have become
             workaholics. They run after money and in doing so they work longer hours. Moreover, today we
             belong to a materialistic society and to buy the luxuries we have to work more. In earlier times, life
             was slower and the needs of people were limited. So people had a lot of free time.

                6. Do you think that the quality of living is increasing? How?
             I feel that the quality of life has increased in many ways and in many ways it has gone down. People
             today enjoy greater comforts and have more money to enjoy life but on the other hand we face
             many problems today such as pollution and global warming which make the quality of life bad.

                7. Today people use machinery to automate everything, is it good or bad?
             It is both – good as well as bad. In many ways it is good. We have more time because of machines.
             We get good quality things because machines make uniform things. We do mass production
             because of automation and this boosts our economy as we can export things to other countries
             when we produce them in bulk.
             On the other hand, many people have lost jobs because of automation. So, unemployment occurs
             and this leads to many other problems in society. Machines can also not give a personal touch to
             things.

               8. How does modern technology help to save time?

  Modern technology has touched all aspects of life. In transport industry we have much faster means
  of travel. In communication, technology has given us tools to connect to others at the click of a
  mouse. In the homes, we have washing machines and microwave ovens, which save our time.

    9. Do you agree that people should let machinery do everything?
  I do not agree that machines should do everything. In that way we shall become slaves of our own
  creation. We should know when, where and how much we have to use machines. We should know
  where to draw the line. When we need mass production, we should take the help of machines. In
  doing repetitive and boring work we can let the machines take over. But where creativity is needed,
  we should do with our own hands.

  assignment/project.
                    IE




    6. Do you think planning is important for time management?
  Yes, planning is essential for good time management. If we don’t plan ahead, we will tend to waste
  time doing tasks/things which are unimportant or unnecessary.

    7. Why do you think some people pay to learn time management?
  Time management has become very important in today’s fast-paced world. Some people pay to
  take courses on time management so that they can succeed and excel at their work. Some people
  are not very good at organizing and managing time, so they need to take up courses on managing
  time well.

             Yes, definitely. We live in a fast paced world and children too need to manage their time well, so
             that they can deal with the competition and do well at their studies and later, at their jobs.

              9. Why do some people find it hard to follow their plans?
             Some people find it hard to follow their plans because of other pressing commitments, like family
             commitments. Some people maybe too lazy to follow their plans.

               10.         10.How would you teach your children time management?
             Time management can be taught to children by helping them make a timetable and ensuring that
             they follow it. Also, children can learn easily from stories or movies, which teach them a lesson
             about the importance of time and managing it well. The parents are role models for children and
             they should set a good example for their children.

               11.        11.Do old people and young people manage time in a similar way?
              No, old and young people do not manage their time the same way. Old people have more life
                experience and they understand the importance of time management better than the young
                generation. The young people may be too impulsive or impatient and may not understand the
                importance of planning ahead. Another difference is the way the younger generation manages
                time. They make more use of technology and the old people may use the traditional methods,
                like a timetable or writing down a list of tasks.

                  It rains the most in my hometown in the monsoon season, that is in the months from June to
           August.

                4. What about the other parts of India? OR In which season does it rain most in other parts of
                    India?
             India has a varied terrain. In many parts of India, it mostly rains in the monsoon season. However,
             it also depends on the geographical location as it affects the rainfall in many regions.

               5. Would you prefer to have, more rain or less rain (in your hometown)?
             I would prefer to have more rain in my hometown. In the last few years, there has been a drastic
             change in the seasons and the summers get very hot. If there is more rainfall in the summers, there
             will be respite from the heat.

                6. Do you like rainy days? OR How do you feel on rainy days? ORDo you feel sad on rainy days?
             I like rainy days in the summer season because the temperatures drop and we get respite from the
             summer heat. In winters I am not too happy when it rains, as it becomes very cold after it rains.

               7. How does rain affect different people’s moods? OR How does rain affect people's lives?
             I think rains affect people’s moods when it restricts their activities or leads to a loss in the work or
             business. Some people feel happy when it rains as the weather becomes pleasant and people can
             enjoy hot beverages and fried snacks.

               8. Do you prefer rainy days or sunny days?
             I prefer rainy days in the summers and sunny days in the winter season. Rains give us respite from
             the heat in the summers and we can enjoy sitting out in the sun on a cold winter day.

               9. What do you do on rainy days (or, on a rainy day)?
             I enjoy hot beverages, like coffee and fried snacks like fritters and samosas on rainy days. It gives
             us an opportunity to stay at home with family and spend quality time with them.

               10.          What do you usually do when it rains (or, when it starts to rain) and you are outside?
              If it rains when I am outside, I usually look for a café or a place where I can sit and enjoy coffee
              and some snacks.

               11.         Do you think rain is good? (Why?)
              Yes, I think rains are good. Rains are important to maintain the ecosystem’s balance. Rains help
              with maintaining the groundwater levels. They make the dust settle down and help clean the
              environment. For agriculture-based economies, rains during the rainy season are very important
              for a good crop.

               12.         How does rain affect (life in) your country?
              Agriculture is a major part of India’s economy and that is largely dependent on timely rains. So a
              lot of farmers depend on a good monsoon season for a good crop. Unseasonal rains can have an
              adverse affect on agriculture, as it can destroy crops. In places where there is water shortage,
              people depend on rains and save rain water in reservoirs.

   13.          Is there any part of India where it doesn't rain much? (Where?) OR Is there an even
       distribution of rain throughout India?
  India is a diverse country with different climates in different parts. There are many parts in the east
  of India that experience a lot of rain throughout the year. In most parts of India, monsoon season
  is the time when most of the rainfall happens. In some western parts, like in the deserts of
  Rajasthan, there is very little rain. Sometimes some states experience droughts because of no
  rainfall for a very long period of time.

   14.         What effects can a shortage of rain (a drought) have on people's lives?
  Droughts/Shortage of rain can have adverse effects on the livelihoods of many people, especially
  those who are dependent on agriculture. Sometimes people are forced to leave their hometowns
  due to water shortage and start afresh somewhere else and face hardships. Many people die each
  year in India and all over the world because of droughts.

   15.           Can you remember any time when it rained particularly heavily in your hometown?
         (When?)




                                                                  o
         Yes, I remember that during my childhood it used to rain continuously for days and the roads
         and parks got filled with water. We used to enjoy a lot playing in the rain and in the pools of




                                                             .c
         water. This used to happen during the monsoon season. Now the amount of rainfall has
         reduced drastically due to climate change.     rs
   16.           Does rain ever affect transportation in your hometown? (How?)
         Yes, sometimes the rain affects the transportation. It is mostly on some roads where the
                                                    e

         drainage system is not good or when it is blocked. At such times the water logging happens
                                               tt


         on the roads and the movement of traffic is affected.

   17.          Do you think the seasons have changed in recent years, compared to the past? (Why?
                                            a




         How?)
                                      M




         Yes, I think seasons have changed in the recent years because of global warming and the
         consequent climate change. The summers last longer and the winters are shorter. Also, the
         amount of rainfall during the monsoon season has reduced. Sometimes we hardly get any
                                     S




         rains during the monsoon season.
